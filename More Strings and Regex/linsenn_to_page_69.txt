PREFACE

The text ofthis book was submitted as a dissertation, written under the supervision of

Prof dr. M. Stol and Prof dr. R.J. van der Spek, in November 2002 to the Faculty of

Arts ofthe Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

I would like to thank Marten Stol and Bert van der Spek for showing a genuine

interest in my dissertation. Their comments and corrections on the different versions of

the text saved me from numerous errors. I am grateful for their continuous support and

patience, including during the years after I had left the university.

The Trustees of the British Museum are thanked for permitting me to collate and

publish texts from the collection. During my visits to the British Museum W.G. Lambert

kindly offered me much needed advise with the reading of some of the unpublished

tablets.

I am also indebted to several scholars at the University of Leiden. Th.J.H. Krispijn

helped me with many of the lamentation incipits. A.C.VM. Bongenaar made some

valuable comments on the manuscript. Special tribute is due to G. van Driel for his help

and advice.

A.R. George kindly allowed me to use his article on temple ritual texts from Babylon

before it was published. St. M. Maul suggested to me how useful A. Poebel’s Grundziige

derswnerischen Grainmcitik still is, when struggling with the difficult Sumerianpassages

in Hellenistic texts.

I also wish to express my gratitude to D. Brown for correcting the English text.

Research for this study, carried out at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, was financed

by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (N.W.O.) from February 1992

until February 1997.

A special word ofthanks I owe to the editor, G. Haayer, for accepting this study for

publication.

I. INTRODUCTION

I.1. Hellenistic Babylonia

The continuation of Babylonian culture in the Hellenistic periodi is well established

today. Work done by scholarslike L.T. Doty, G.J.P. McEwan, A. Kuhrt, S. Sherwin-White,

J. Oelsner and R.J. van der Spek2 has shown that not only Uruk and Babylon, but also

other Babylonian cities (Nippur, Larsa, Ur, Borsippa, Cutha and Kis/Hursagkalamma)3

flourished after the coming ofthe Greeks. Both archaeology and textual sources indicate

that in these cities the Babylonian inhabitants ^tuck to their ancient traditions, which

included the use of cuneiform. Whether Akkadian was still used as a //vmg languag^

the Hellenistic period is uncertain,^ but on the basis ofthe so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca

tablets and Classic£d'somces^^as been argued that cuneiform could well have been

read up to the third century A.D.^,

The cuneiform sources also contain a wealth of information on the Babylonian cults

and the temples in the Hellenistic period. It is the purpose of this study to examine

these cults more closely and present an inventory of all attested cultic activities. The

key question will be: can we use the templejdhmligxts.as„gvideiice for Mlgalstic cuft

practices? To answer this question we cannot restrict our research to the temple ritual

texts alone; because these texts are literary compositions copied from older originals,

we cannot be sure that what they depict about the public cult was actually taking place

in the temples during the Hellenistic period. For this reason we will not only analyse the

ritual texts in detail, but also compare the evidence with information^leaned fromtigft^

which are (unlike the temple ritual textslunquestionably Hellenistic compogitions, such

as building inscriptions, legal docunignts (including prebend texts), chronicles and the

so-called astronomical diaries. Which rituals, ceremonies and offerings are attested in

these texts? TOich deities and temples are mentioned, and does the pantheon attested

in these texts correspond with the names of gods mentioned in the temple ritual texts?

This comparison will hopefully tell us whether the cults ofBel, Anu, Istar and the other

1 Because one ofthe most important characteristics ofthe Babylonian culture, the cuneiform script, survives

not only during the Seleucid period, but also well into the Arsacid period, we will use in this book the

more general term ‘Hellenistic’, which begins with the conquest ofBabylonia by Alexander in 331 B.C. md

continues up to the end ofthe Arsacid period (224/226 A.D.). Cf. J. Oelsner, Materialien, 51—57. On occasion

we will also referto texts as being ‘Late Babylonian’, which in this study means, written after Babylonia lost

its independence (539 B.C.), i.e. during the Achaemenid or Hellenistic periods.

Aramaic) the-Akkadian language was still spoken in small city regions in the Hellenistic penod cannot be

/. Introduction

deities were alive and flourishing in the Hellenistic period, or whether, perhaps under

the influence ofthe new Macedonian rulership, a process of change and decay had set

in.

Because the textual evidence relating to the cults in the Hellenistic period concerns for

the most part the main sanctuaries of Uruk (Res and Esgal) and Babylon (Esagila), in

this study we will confine ourselves to the cults ofthese two cities, although it should be

noted that this undoubtedly results in a slightly distorted picture ofHellenistic Babylonia

as a whole.

In 1.2 the text material relevant for this study is discussed. In 1.3 we will make

some general observations about the cult, the priests and temple personnel and the

cult-terminology. In chapter II all the ceremonies, rituals and festivals attested in

the Hellenistic corpus will be described. In chapter III we will analyse the offerings,

libations, fumigations, and purifications which were performed during the divinemeal.

Much has been written on religion and cults in Mesopotamia, but only a few studies

concentrated on the Hellenistic period. Exceptions are Furlani’s studies on offerings and

ceremonies,^ and Blome’s analysis of the offering materials.'^ which to a large extent

are based on texts from the Hellenistic period. Since the publication ofthese books in

the 1930’s, much new evidence has been discovered and published. This was used in a

limited way much later by McEwan in his dissertation on the temple organization and

the temple personnel of Hellenistic Babylonia, with one short chapter on the cult.^ As

the author indicated himself, however this was only a ‘limited outline ofthe main aspects

ofthe cult during this period’.^

Other scholars took an interest in the cults of Hellenistic Babylonia. A short

description ofthe gods and cult ofUruk was written by Rutten.io Furthermore(Schroeder

published an article on the pantheon of Uruk Falkenstein wrote an important study

on the topography ofUruk, which concentrates to a large extent on the cultic buildings,

and contains much important information on the cult;i2 this work has now partly been

updated by George^^ and Pongratz-Leisten. Beaulieu’s article on the origin ofthe Anu- pantheon in Late Babylonian Uruk is important. Finally, Konstanze Szelenyi-Graziotto

published an article on the cult in Babylon in the Seleucid period.Nevertheless, an

extensive analysis ofthe Hellenistic cults ofBabylonia, based on the latest evidence, is

still missing. A new discussion is necessary.

1.2. The texts

1.2. The texts17

The temple ritual texts are especially relevant for studying the Babylonian cults, since

they give us the most detailed information on public cult activities in the sanctuaries

ofthe cities. 18 These texts contain prescriptive rituals, recording what happened in the

temple before the eventsin question, as a manual ofritual procedure. 19 Fortunately for the

Hellenistic period a large corpus ofthese often very elaborate ritual texts is available.20

They deal with instructions for all sorts of cultic proceedings, such as offerings and

libations for the gods, and also prescribe prayers and cult songs which have to be

recited; sometimes these recitations are not only referred to by their incipits, but are

cited in full. The rituals deal withvarious subjects ofthe public cult, such asthe New.Year

festival, the night vigil, the preparation ofthe kettledrum, building rituals for temples,

and'the evil consequences of an ecl_ipse_qf the moon. This group oftemple ritual texts

will serve as the main source material for this study- Other relevant text groups, already

collected by J. Oelsner,2i are the explanatory and commentary texts,^2 cult songs,23

calendar texts,24 but also building inscriptions, chronicles, administrative documents,25

(unpublished). In this explanatory text days 5 to 11 ofthe first month Nisannu are discussed, and therefore

it possibly refers to the New Year festival. Unfortunately the tablet is badly damaged and the interpretation

is difficult. The small script indicates that the text is Late Babylonian, possibly Hellenistic. Because of

the invocational formula [ina INIM <*EN] u <*GA§AN-id lis-lim (U.E.), only attested in Late Babylonian

colophons (see the literature mentioned in my comments on TU 39 U.E., in the Appendix), the text may be

from Babylon. We willreturn to thistext in a separate study. Another explanatory text, perhaps from Borsippa

but foimd in Babylon, is BM 34035 (Sp 1131). The text partly explains rituals in terms ofmyths, by maldng

use ofsymbolism. A large explanatory text, IM 44150 (-(- //), was published by George (BTT, no. 18,145 ff.).

Of the five manuscripts, two or possibly three are Late Babylonian, and, because of the very small script,

perhaps Hellenistic (cf TIM 9, p. xii.). Col. Ill, 12'ff deals with festivals, one ofwhich is the aAftw-festival.

calendar text for the 4th month Du’uzu; it lists body parts of animals for every day, probably to be used in

ritual activities. For the latest on IqTsa see J. Oelsner, in: J. Zablocka, St. Zawadzki (eds.), Sulmu IV, 236-7,

/. Introduction

and astronomical diaries.26 Classical authors like Diodurus Siculus, Strabo, Josephus or

Berossus (to name just a few) are important for reconstructing the political history, but

are less informative so far as the Babylonian cult practices are concerned.

When studying the cults we are faced with several problems. While some of the

ceremonies and rituals are well attested, about others we know only very little, and

undoubtedly many more must have existed about which we know nothing at all. Because

the Neo-Assyrian period has left us with many ritual texts, on occasion we will refer to

some ofthese texts for parallels, because we may safely assume a common backgroimd

for both Assyrian and Babylonian cult practices. However, a comparison between the

two is not without dlfliculties, and it is clear that we are far from explaining the gaps in

our knowledge of one period by looking at the other. Nevertheless, although many texts

contain rituals for a special occasion, it must be expected that many of the offerings,

libations, ftimigations, purifications and recitations referred to in these texts reflect the

common practice ofthe ordinary temple cult.27 As far as the Neo-Babylonian period is

concerned, we must keep in mind that relevant NeoJBabylonian references to the cults

are often not from ritual texts, but from administrative and'private documents.

Another problem is that many of the texts do not give us the iiftbrmation that we

need: the texts often only record the ceremony, without explaining how and when it was

performed, and what its fimction was. This makesjt often very difficult to distinguish

cyclical ceremonies from occasional ceremonies. It also leaves us insufficient data to

compare and combine Assyrian and Babylonian cultic calendars.

In this section we will &st list the temple ritual texts from Uruk and Babylon. Then

the date ofthe texts is discussed. ^

Uruk

We can distinguish three groups ofliterary texts, distinct according to provenance, and

dated to the Hellenistic period28;

1) the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts. Most ofthese texts were found in the Res-temple area

Le XVI 3.29

2) Hellenistic texts in TU. They were illicitly excavated and have become available via

the antiquities market, but were probably found either at the same location in the

W

26 Up to now four volumes ofthe astronomical diaries have appeared, cf. A.J. Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries.

22 Cf. G. van Driel, Cult ofAssur, 151-4. The most relevant texts for the Neo-Assyrian cult are briefly

discussed in ib., 5Iff. Important for the monthly ceremonies is also the hemerological series inbu bel

arhim Truit (=epithet of the moon god Sin), Lord of the month’; unfortunately only the description by

B. Lapasberger, Kult. Kalender, 100-45 is available, since most ofthe texts are not published. See also the

comments on this series by G. van Driel, Cult ofAssur, 154—59, R. Labat, in RLA 4 (1972-1975), 319f,

and A. Livingstone, in E.'Matsushima (ed.), Official cult and popular religion in the ancient near east,

Heidelberg, 1993, 97-113.

28 The material was brought together by J. Oelsner, Materialien, 139 ff.; see also id., in: J. Zablocka, St.

Zawadzki (eds.), Sulmu IV, 235 ff., without taking into account the new texts published in SpTU 4.

29 But not all tablets were foxmd here, see J. Oelsner, Materialien, 143-44.

1.2. The texts

Res-temple area as the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts,30 or they came from other locations

within the Res-temple.3i

3) Hellenistic texts in the SpTU 1—5-collection. They were almost all excavated from

the living quarters Ue XVIII1, and are part ofprivate archives.

Other illicitly excavated tablets may also have come from one of these places, as is

indicated by the fact that Uruk scribes, attested for example in the colophons ofBRM

4-texts, also turn up in the TU- and SpTU-tQxts (see below).

These texts can be attributed to four Uruk families, named after their ancestors Ekur- zakir, Sin-leqe-unnini, Hunzu and Ahutu. These families were all^connected with tl^

temple and every family specialized in one profession, e.g. the Ekur-zakir members

made their living as exorcists (dsipu)’, well-known are the exorcists Anu-iksur, IqTsa and

Nidintu-Anu. The Sm-leqe-uimlni fSiily specialized a^n^ntation priests (^M); well- known is especially Anu-belsunu, son ofNidintu-Anu.^2 Rarely, alsomen^grsofofrffr

families are attested as kaiu or asipu, e.g. the exorcist Anu-belsunu ofthe Hunzu-family.

The archives which can be reconstructed on the basis ofprosopographical evidence

contain a wide variety oftext genres, but also show the scribe’s particular professional

interest: the exorcist is mainly concerned with incantations and incantation rituaN,

medicaltexts, omina and lexical lists, while the lamentationpriest concentrates especially

on cultsong and ritual texts. The libraries ofthese scribes also contain other literary texts,

referred to by Oelsner as ‘Bildungsgut’,33 i.e. texts which.were copied for educational

purposes, e.g. omina, historical texts, but also, for example, parts from Enuma elis. We

may safely assume that the archives contain not only what the scribe needed for his

profession, but also everything he had collected from the start ofhis career on. This also

included legal documents, which are not only known from the SpTU-corpus, but also

among the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts found in Le XVI3. This may indicate that not only

the texts which are found in the living quarters Ue XVIII1 were part ofprivate archives,

but also those which were stored in the Res-temple.34

There appears, then, to be no real difference between the archives kept in the temple

and at home. The scribes appear to have stored their tablets both in the Res-temple

libraries {TU, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2) and in the libraries in their private houses {SpTU).

E.g. texts which belong to the archives of the exorcist IqTsa, son of Istar-suma-eres,

descendant ofEkur-zakir, or to those ofthe exorcist Nidintu-Anu, son ofAnu-belsunu,

descendant ofEkur-zakir, have turned up from both the Res-temple area and the living

quarters Ue XVIII.35 xhis strongly suggests that the Hellenistic temple ritual texts were

I. Introduction

not copied for personal interest alone, but also served a purpose in the temple cult (we

will further illustrate this below). With this in mind we must now turn our attention to

the temple ritual texts.

For the Hellenistic period we are fortunate to have some large fragments of a series

of temple rituals from Uruk, which inform us about the public cult practices in the

temples. The original series must have covered the whole year.36 These temple ritual

texts contain information about what went on from day to day, or describe rituals and

festivals which were celebrated on special days of the year. Most of the temple ritual

texts ofthe Hellenistic period deal with the cult ofAnu in the Res-temple, and only one

text is related to the cult ofIstar in the Esgal-temple. Texts which belong to these series

all have in common the fact that the priests who perform the ritual are addressed in the

third person only, unlike rituals which are performed for a special occassion, where the

leading priest is addressed in the second person (the ‘you’-figure).

Very important for our understanding ofdaily practice in the temple is TU 38, a text

with ritual instructions for daily offerings in the temples of Anu, Istar, Nanaja and the

other gods in Uruk.

Furthermore we have several texts which concern the New Year festival {aldtu). TU

39-40 describes the New Year festival of the seventh month TasrTtu in Uruk. BRM 4,

7 describes a programme for the procession ofthe statue of Anu during the New Year

festival, from his cella to the center of the Res-temple, and then going outside to the

a^frM-temple. It lists incantations and prayers to be recited during the procession.

We also have texts dealingwiththe New Year festivals ofthe first monthNisannu.KAR

132 describes the ritual for the procession ofAnu to the a^fifw-temple, concentrating on

the movements ofthe gods and the objects which accompany them during the procession.

Bagh. Mitt Beih. 2, no. 13 is a fragment describing a procession ofthe gods similar to

KAR 132. TU 43, a fragment ofa ritual for the New Year festival ofthe month Nisannu,

contains a hand-raising prayer {suillakku) for Anu; this text gives us more information

on day 10 and 11 ofthis festival.

Another importanttextis TU 42 +: the text describes a festival for Istar, and must have

belonged to a larger series oftemple ritual texts dealing with the cult ofIstar of Uruk.

In which month this festival was celebrated is not clear. The obverse records the same

ceremonies, which for days 8 and 9 ofthe New Year festival of Anu are also preserved

(see TU 39-40). The last part of the obverse and the reverse describe the procession

ofIstar from the Esgal-temple to the a/a/w-temple, and resembles the Anu-procession

described in 132.

TU 41 contains a ritual for days 16 and 17 of an unknown month, describing the

good-functioning ofthe temple ceremony (saldm biti) and the vigil (bajjdtu) held during

36 Which is indicated, for example, by Tt/ 38, where a list of offerings and ceremonies is given which are

‘written down in (the tablets of) the rites for the whole year’ (rev. 38). See also TU 39-40, which contains

the rites for the seventh month TagiTtu, after which the colophon refers to the next tablet containing the rites

of the eighth month Arabsamna {TU 39, rev. 25 f.). Texts which describe ritual proceedings for the whole

year on one single tablet are unknown as far as the Hellenistic period is concerned, but we do have LKU,

no. 51, dated to the late Neo-Babylonian or early Achaemenid period, listing ceremonies for Belet-sa-Uruk,

Usm-amassu and Aska’itu for all twelve months ofthe year. For the date see A. Falkenstein, LKU, 1.

1.2. The texts

the night in the Res-temple. Pongratz-Leisten37 has suggested that this ritual perhaps

was performed during the tenth month Tebetu, because TU 38 records offerings to

the planets which have to be performed on top of the temple tower on the sixteenth

of Tebetu,38 which can be connected with TU 41, since there offerings are brought to

the planets on the sixteenth day.39 Because part of the ritual is performed by a priest

addressed in the second person, TU 41 probably does not belong to the large series of

temple rituals covering the whole year.^o

The temple ritual text W 18728, published by Falkenstein,^! was probably written

in the Hellenistic period and deals with clothing instructions for different persons,

including several priests and the king.^!^ The Hellenistic text W 18828, also published by

Falkenstein,43 contains ritual instructions for work in the temple workshop (bit mummi)

with a hymn to Samas. Unfortunately only three lines ofthe ritual are partly preserved.

The fragment Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 14 is perhaps also a ritual.

The Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts and probably also TU 3S-A3 come from one or more

locations within the Res-temple and appear to belong to the corpus of at least one

exorcist (asipu): TU 38 and TU 39^0 were written by the exorcist Samas-etir, son

of Ina-qibTt-Anu, son of Sibqat-Anu, decendant of the asipu-f?imi\y Ekur-zakir. The

colophon of rU 38 states that the exorcist Kidin-Anu, descendant ofEkur-zakir, copied

the text in Elam and brought it back with him to Uruk. The owner of TU 39-40 is also

an exorcist, although not from the Ekur-zakir family: Anu-uballit, son ofNidintu-Anu,

son ofIna-qibTt-Anu, descendant offjlunzu. For TU 41^3 no colophons are preserved.

The colophon ofBRM 4, 7 indicates that the text was written by Anu-balassu-iqbi,

son ofthe owner ofthe tablet, the exorcistAnu-aha-usabsi, son ofKidin-Anu, descendant

of Ekur-zakir. It also informs us that the scribe ‘has written (the tablet) for his (own)

instruction, his long days, his well-being and the permanence ofhis position and set (it)

up in Uruk and in the Res-temple, the temple of his lordship’ (rev. 45-47), indicating

perhaps that he made two copies, one for his private library at home and one which was

kept in the temple, where it was available to the public cult. Furthermore, he wrote the

text for himself, which shows that the text was part of his private archive. We have no

other prosopographical information on Anu-balassu-iqbi, buthis father, Anu-aha-usabsi,

is also attested as the owner ofthe chronicle text SpTU 1, no. 2 (dated 61 S.E.), found in

the living quarters Ue XVIII,44 which indicatesthat Anu-a|ia-usabsi had a private archive

in his home in the Ue XVIII area, like the better known exorcists Anu-iksur, IqTsa, and

Nidintu-Anu. BRM 4, 7 and the other texts which name Anu-a^a-usabsi as the owner

,or scribe45 may have come from this library as well, but it is equally possible that some

I. Introduction

ofthese texts were kept in the Res-temple. Note that two ofthe Anu-aha-usabsi-tablets,

TU 19 and W 18828 both probably come from the Res-area, although the exact location

remains uncertain.

W 18728 was found together with W 18828 in the Res-temple. The contents ofKAR

132 suggests that it belongs to the temple ritual series similar to TU 38-43, but the tablet

comes from illicit digging and the colophon is lost.

A few texts which deal with the eclipse of the moon ritual perhaps also belong to

this group. In BRM 4, 6 and BM 134701^6 the eclipse ofthe moon ritual is described

extensively. Thompson, CLBT, pi. 1, contains some kind of (lunar eclipse?) ritual, and

furthermore a lunar eclipse myth; col. B is partly duplicated by the Uruk XsyXBRM 4,

which makes it likely that the former was also written in Uruk.^s This is confirmed by

col. A, 27 where the Res-temple, and the Enamenna, the cella ofAnu in the Res-temple,

are mentioned. Although no colophons have been preserved which attribute these texts

to the corpus of the dsipu,^^ we know that the exorcist plays an important role in the

eclipse ritual.

A second group oftemple rituals belongs to the corpus ofthe lamentation priest (kalu).

They do not belong to the large series oftemple ritual texts, but are rituals for special

occasions. Several texts deal with the kettledrum {lilissu), most important of which is

TU 44.50 Partial duplicates are Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, no. 7, and perhaps also the

fragment no. 9. Here we should also mention Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 6, a bilingual

hand-raising prayer (suillakku) for the consecration ofthe bull, whose hide is used to

cover the kettledrum.51

The building rituals also belong to the corpus ofthe lamentation priest. TU 45 and

TU 46 are in many ways very similar, but there are also important differences between

them.52 Other duplicates are Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, and no. 11.

The texts belonging to this second group probably all come from the Res-temple

area Le XVI 3. The colophons indicate that most of the texts belong to the archive of

^ The latter was published by D. Brown and the present author in: BM 134701 = 1965-10-14,1 and the

Hellenistic period eclipse ritual from Uruk, RA 91 (1997), 147-166.

4* Cf. W.G. Lambert, JCS 16 (1962), 74b. The fact that the tablet was written in Uruk, does not necessarily

mean that J. Oelsner, Materialien, 207-8, was wrong in assuming that the tablet was probably found in

Babylon.

49 Note however that Thompson, CLBT, pi. 1, col. B, 29 perhaps refers to ‘the office of the exorcist’

ia-si-\pu-ti{l)]). See the Appendix.

50 The text is partly a duplicate ofthe Neo-Assyrian textKAR 60.

51 Important for our rmderstanding of the kettledrum ritual is the Neo-Assyrian text KAR 50, which is

apparently a shortened version ofthe ritual. On the obverse we find a bilingual incantation for ‘the choice

bull, the creation ofthe great gods’. The reverse describes the actual ritual. Part ofthe text is duplicated by

K 6060 {BBR 2, no. 56) + K 10820 (see Plate II). Also relevant is the Neo-Assyrian text IVR^, 23, no. 1 +

K 9421 (for the latter see Plate III); here several recitations, known from other kettledrum ritual texts, are

presented in full.

52 TU 46 is also partially duplicated by the Late Babylonian Uruk text SpTU4, no. 141. The Late Babylonian

text F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no. 12 from Babylon is partially a duplicate ofthese texts. As SpTU 4, no. 141

it contains the beginning ofthe recitation Eniima Anu ibnu same, only referred to by its incipit is the Uruk

version TU 46. Another part ofthis recitation is attested in the unpublished Rm 101 (see Plate IV and my

comments on 1. 24ff. ofF.H. Weissbach, Misc., no. 12, in the Appendix).

/. Introduction

For the month Simanu we are almost solely dependant on BM 32656, a temple ritual

fragment probably from the Hellenistic period, which is published by A.R. George.63

The rituals in this texts do not deal with the cult of Marduk or his son Nabu, but with

the cult ofIstar of Babylon in the temple Eturkalamma, which must have had its own

ritual series.

Until recently our most important source for the month KislTmu was the calendar text

SBH VII // BRM 4, 25. Important new evidence for the month KislTmu is now available

from a large Esagila-ritual text dealing specifically with this month, BM 32206 +.^4 The

text, part ofthe ritual series ofBabylon, describes city ceremonies in Babylon on days 3

and 4 ofthe month KislTmu and gives us new evidence for cultic activities in this month.

The procession to the a^/w-temple outside Babylon is esspecially important.65 The text

also contains references to the so-called palm festival.^6

The date ofthe texts

In many cases the text contains a colophon with the name ofthe writer and/or the owner,

the place where the tablet was written, and a date.^7 Sometimes, when the date is lost or

missing, prosopographical information can also help us in dating the text.^s Other texts

have to be dated on palaeographical, grammatical and linguistic groimds, e.g. the signs

lu and ku written without the top horizontal wedge, the use of the aleph-sign ' on the

end of words, or the prefix ta- and tu- for the third p. fern. sing, verb (an example of

Aramaic influence).^9 A very small script is also an important indication for a late date.

Sometimes the archaeological history of a tablet i.e. the place where, and stratum in

which, it was found can help us. Nevertheless, we are not always able to date a text more

specifically then ‘Late Babylonian’ (i.e. from the Achaemenid or Hellenistic period).

-1.2. The texts

We know that at least in some cases the texts are copied in the Hellenistic period

from older originals, as is specifically stated for example in the colophons ofTU 38, TU

39-40, BRM 4, 7, TU 44, and W 18828. For this reason we must assume that many if

not all ofour texts describe older rituals, going back several centuries. When were these

older rituals written? For Uruk it is clear that the texts appear to have been adjusted to the

Late Babylonian situation: the gods mentioned in the texts belong to the Anu-pantheon

of the Late Babylonian period, and not to the Istar-pantheon of the Neo-Babylonian

period.

Also the topography of Uruk as manifested in the texts is clearly Late Babylonian,

in the texts, the Res- and Esgal-temples, and not the Eanna-temple complex, are the

dominating sanctuaries ofthe city. Consequently most of our texts are probably copies

of older rituals written at the latest during the fifth cqntury.^o However, it is possible

that these texts are adaptations of even older rituals going back to the Neo-Babylonian

period. We do not know much about these older rituals, but one example of such a

document has been preserved which gives us some inside information on the cult in

Uruk before the Anu-pantheon was introduced. This text, LKU no. 51, was probably

written during the Late Neo-Babylonian or early Achaemenid period.^i It appears to be a

list of offerings, ceremonies and processions for the whole year, but also ofthe days, on

which the lamentation priest {kalu) had to perform his cultic duties. The twelve mo^hs

of the year are discussed, but the first two months, and part of the third are lost. The

goddesses Belet-sa-Uruk (= Istar), Usur-amassu and Aska’itu in the Eanna-temple are

the main protagonists. The text is in many ways similar to the temple ritual texts from

Hellenistic Uruk, especially TU 42 +, in which Istar also plays an important part.72

The Babylon ritual DT 15 + {RAcc., Illff.) may also be an adaptation of an older

ritual going back to the Neo-Babylonian period. Thureau-Dangin assumed that the text

was written during the Hellenistic period.73 Zimmem concluded that ‘dieses Neujahrs- festritual, wenigstens in seinem jetzigen Wortlaut, nicht etwa, wie mancher sonstige

spate Text, eine sklavische Kopie aus alterer Zeit ist, sondem vielmehr auf der Grund- lage alterer Vorlagen eine freie Konzeption des Neujahrsfestrituals far die Priesterschaft

des Esagil-Tempels in Babylon aus der spatesten, seleukidisch-parthischen, Periode

Finally, the important Late Babylonian Esagila-ritual concerned with the month

KislTmu, BM 32206 +, is possibly also of Hellenistic date, but refers back to older

originals, as Lambert suggested.75

I. Introduction

1.3. The cult

Some general observations

According to Mesopotamian theology the gods are the creators of the world and of

humans; the latter had to serve the gods in return for individual and communal prosperity

and well-being. This service involved providing everything the gods needed to lead a '

comfortable existence, and was formalized in order to avoid ^v mistakes or negligence,

"v^ich would haye had disastrous consequences for the people and their cities. This

formalized service for the gods is the cult.

In general, one could define a cult as a form, a practice in which the worshipping of ,

a divinity takes place. In a cult communication with the divine is expressed in certain

word^ formulas, gestures and actions. One usually distinguishes between, first, a more

individual worshipping, and secondly, a common worshipping, the official cult, which

was performed by a community; the cultisthen expressed in feasts and gatherings. Cultic

acts such as offerings, purifications, cultic meals, prayers, incantations and processions,

are often performed in or near sacred places like temples.

The Mesopotamians envisaged the cult in an anthropomorphic way: although the gods

were thought to reside in heaven and the underworld, in every Mesopotamian city many

gods also lived in their own temples. Furthermore, each city also had its own main

god, a city patron, who resided in the major temple, where he or she was represented

by an anthropomorphic statue. The statues were considered to be manifestations ofthe

gods on earth; rather than being mere images they were regarded as extensions ofthe

personality ofthe gods. The statues were identified with the gods in question and were

considered to be like living beings, who, just like humans, had to eat, sleep, wake and

be dressed, and were therefore in the center of ceremonies and presented with regular ^ and special offeringsQ'he statue|‘served as the focal point for sacrificial activities’.'^^

The cultic proceefeigs were probably based on Babylonian court practices. Like a

king living with his family and servants in the palace, in the temple the main god of

the city lived with other gods who acted as his family and servants. Under the guidance

of priests the inhabitants of the city were responsible for the worship and feeding of

the gods throughout the year. However, the temple was not a place were everyone came

together to worship the god. Only certain priests and other temple personnel, who were

able to perform the often elaborate ceremonies and rituals, and on occasion, for example

during the New Year festival, the king or a high official of the city, had access to the

temple. There is much written evidence concerning the official temple cult, especially

in the ritual texts. Ofthe private popular religion not much is known.77

Life, SHCANE VII, Leiden, New York, Koln, 1996; id., in: K.R. Veenhof(ed.). Houses and Households in

12

1.3. The cult

The temple was not only a religious centre. Although it was considered to be the house

ofthe god (and as such all the temple property was the property ofthe mam god ofthe

temple) it was also an economic center, raising taxes (tithes), owning land, slaves and

livestock, and taking part in trade and money-lending. In return the temple provided a

large part of the income of citizens who performed certain duties in connection with

the temple, either by distributing part ofliie temple income or by paying wages. Also

leasing temple land to tenants was important. The temple was, together with the palace,

to a large extent in charge ofthe land and the economic activities.^^

A clear definition ofthe cult is never presented in texts from Mesopotamia. However, the

colophon ofthe ritual text 777 38 gives us an idea of how the priesthood ofHellenistic

Uruk envisaged the cult to be (rev. 44-50):

‘"*4Wax-table (containing) the rites for the Anu-worship, the pure 5M/M^^M-purification rites,

the ritual regulations of kingship, including(?) the divine iu/uMM-purification rites of the

Res-temple, the Esgal-temple, ^sthe Eanna-temple and the (other) temples of Uranna, the

ritual activities ofthe exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers and the craftsmen, all

ofthem, who are subservient to the ..., not to mention all that concerns the apprentices, m

accordance with the contents ofthe tablets, 47whichNabopolassar, king ofthe Sealand, earned

o&isalalu) from Uruk. And at that time(?) Kidin-Anu from Uruk, ^sthe exorcist ofAnu and

Antu, descendant of Ekur-zakir, the high priest of the Res-temple, 49saw ^sthese tablets in

the land ofElam and during the reign of Seleucus and Antiochus, the kings, 50he copied and

brought (them) to Uruk’.

Here, clearly, an attempt is being made to give a complete description ofthe cult in Uruk.

The text first mentions the rites for the main deity Anu, followed by the purification

rites Then it refers to the duties ofthe king in the cult. The purification rites of all the

temples ofUruk are recorded, after which those who are responsible for performmg the

cult in these temples are enumerated. Finally, it gives an explanation for the origin of

the cult instructions.

The main temples and their gods

Where was the official cult practised?'^^ jn Babylon the ancient Esagila-temple complex

was still the most important cultic building of the city in the Hellenistic period,

constituting the centre of the Bel-Marduk-cult.80 The pantheon of Babylon remained

I. Introduction

unchanged in the Hellenistic period, as becomes clear not only from the ritual texts and

other non-cultic sources, but also from a large group of cult songs;^^ although most of

these texts are probably not Hellenistic compositions but copies of older originals, we

know that these texts were still used for the cult ofthe old gods, because not only were

many ofthese texts copied in Hellenistic Babylon, buttheir colophons indicate that these

copies were used ‘for singing’ {ana zamdri), which can only mean that they were used

in the cult.^2

The Esagila-temple remained in use at least until the first century A.D. as we know >

from astronomical texts, the latest of which is dated to 75 A.D.83 The astronomical

diaries mention the assembly (kinistu) and administrator (satammu) of Esagila in 78

B.C.84 Other temples are attested in the archive of a temple official called Rahimesu

(94-92 B.C.)^^: Eturkalamma, the temple ofIstar of Babylon,^^ Esabad, the temple of

Gula in Babylon,^^ and furthermore the temples ofZababa and Ninlil,88 Nabu-sa-hare,^^

Madanu and the aAJ^w-temple.^o

In Uruk an important change came about during the Late Babylonian period. In the Neo- Babylonian period Inanna/Istar was the most important god ofthe city of Uruk, living

in the Eanna-complex, but injhe Hellenistic period Anu was the most prominent deity,

residing in the Resjemple, at thattime the most important sanctuary ofthe city. Building

inscriptions inform us about extensive building activities and reconstructions not only

ofthe Res-temple of Anu, but also of the Esgal-temple of Istar during the Hellenistic

period.91 Several aAf/w-temples are known from Hellenistic Uruk.92 The temple tower

ofJLJrukj the largest ever constructed in Mesopotamia, was also built in the Hellenistic

period.93

Evidence for the new pantheon in Uruk comes not^nly. from ritual texts but also

from cult songs, which like those ofBabylon, were proJ^ably-iiillji&edior tihe_cult^in^^^

H^ibnistifi4ifiriod.94 Furthermore in the Uruk prebend texts and in proper names (as the

divine name-element) also the same gods appear: Anu together with his spouse Antu

was at the head ofthe new pantheon, consisting ofEnlil, Ea, Sin, Samas, Adad, Marduk,

1.3. The cult

Papsukkal, Amasagnudi, Istar, Belet-seri, Nanaia, Belet-sa-Res, and ^rrahitu.^^. How

and when did this change come about?

According to the colophon of TU 38 the entire cult of the Hellenistic period

in Uruk must have originated in the Neo-Babylonian period. Falkenstein interpreted

this colophon as propaganda from the Urukaean priesthood designed to legitimate the

Late Babylonian Anu-cult.96 We know that this process of change from Istap:^to

predominance took place over a longer period oftime, and was not an invention of_fce

priests of Hellenistic Uruk. Evidence from the Late Babylonian period has confirmed

this: based on onomastic evidence Beaulieu concluded that probably between 521, the

first regnal year of Darius I, and 424, the first regnal year of Darius II, Anu took over

from Istar.97 After the conquest of the Neo-Babylonian empire by .Cyrus in 539 the

Eeg^nbny of the national god and the god of the capital, Marduk, came to an end.

Provincial centers like Uruk were now fr^ to promote thejr own ygrsion ofthe national

pantheon, anft placed Anu (not only the old deity of Uruk, but also, before Marduk s

nse~at the^nd of die second millennium, the god who presided (together with Enlil)

over the national pantheon) at the head ofthis new panthean. This was done in part by

using the Middle Babylonian god list An =_Anum, which was a source ofinspiration for

Uruka^ ‘ antiquarian'’’ theologians^’Furthermore itis quite possible, as Pongratz-Leisten

has suggested,^^ that tolerant Persianrulers allowed local cultsto gp their own way,_since

they were more concerned withpolitical_and.economical matters in Babylonia. For Anu

and his consort Antu a new temple complex was built, the Res-temple,^9 while Istar and

Nanaja, previously residing in the Eanna-temple, moved to the Esgal-complex. ftijexts

from the Hellenistic period the Eanna-temple is referred to_only_r^eJy, and apparently

had Idst’mucli ofits cuitic^ction in favour ofthe Res: and Esgal-temples.ioo We know

that'both of these temples still existedTMand functioned normally in the early Arsacid

period. 191

95 See R- A. Beaulieu, ASJ 14 (1992), 53-60. Cf. also B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi Trub, 136-143. Older

discussions ofthe Uruk pantheon are O. Schroeder, in SPAW 41 (1916), 1180-1196; M. Rutten, Contrats de

I’epoque Seleucide conserves au musee du Louvre, 36-63.

98 ina sulmi Trub, 143. ■ 99 A. Falkenstein {Topographie, 8) already noted that a temple called Res is indirectly attested in texts from

the Neo-Babylonian period: texts belonging to the Eanna-archive mention the goddess Belet-sa-Res. Note,

however, that this goddess also appears in the aimals ofSennacherib, cf D.D. LuckenbUl, OIP 2, p. 87,31-33,

where several deities dwelling in Uruk are mentioned, among which (in 31) is Belet-sa-Res {sd re'-e-si).

100 Texts from Eanna become rare after the second regnal year of Darius I (520/19 B.C.), which has led

some scholars to assume that Eanna was destroyed by Darius I. However, as M. Dandamayev has shown

{AMI 25 [1992], 169-72), documentary evidence from the Late Achaemenid period clearly undermines this

hypothesis.

101 A quitclaim written during the reign ofMithridates II (K. Kessler, Bagh. Mitt. 15 [1984], 273-81, dated

108 B.C.) refers to the Res-temple, the Esgal-temple and the other temples ofUruk and relates to the sale

ofprebend shares, which shows that temple service was still taking place. Cf S. Sherwin-White, A. Kuhrt,

From Samarkhand to Sardis, 155. In the astronomical diaries from Babylon Uruk is mentioned as late as 83

B.C., cf A.J. Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries, no. -82, A, obv. 20.

I. Introduction

The officials

Who were responsible for the rituals and ceremoniesin the temples?i02 inthe Babylonian

language there is no general word for ‘priest’. There are officials whose duties are strictly

confined to (religious) tasks in the temple, and who are considered to be initiates, i.e.

who belong to a group ofpersons possessing secret knowledge, which may not be shared

with outsiders. See for example the following warning in the Uruk kettledrum ritual TU

44, III, 29-30:

‘29This ritual procedure, which you perform, only the novice (tarbutu) ^Omay see (it); an

outsider, someone who is not responsible for the rites (la mar bel parsi), may not see

(it)’.i03

McEwan has discussed all the ‘priests’ known from the Hellenistic period. Most

often mentioned in texts from Hellenistic Babylonia is the exorcisv^sipuW^^ We know

that he played a major part in the temple rituals from Uruk^Q^ and Babylon, p is

this magical expert who takes char^e_of most ritual activities, because in many official

rituals it was.importapt to avert evil and obtein ritual^purity bymeans_pf all sorts of

magical activities. Many of our texts can be attributed to the corpus of the exorcist

(dsiputu)}^^

Furthermore there are special priests, who were responsible for performing the

recitations, such as the singer (ndru), the lamentation priests (kalu) and the chiefsinger

102 In contrast to Egypt and Israel the administration of the temples in Babylonia was performed by civil

servants who had no priestly duties. These civil servants were discussed by G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS 4, 25 ff.

and R.J. van der Spek, Grondbezit in het Seleucidische rijk, 57fF. (Babylon) and 79 ff. (Uruk) (an English

summary in: A. Kuhrt, S. Sherwin-White (ed.), Hellenism in the East, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1987,

57-74). Many references to Babylonian cultic personnel are also to be foimd in R.A. Henshaw, Female and

Male.

103 Cf. G.J.R McEwan, FAOS 4, 10. For this secret knowledge see P.- A. Beaulieu, Z4 82 (1992), 98 ff.

'O'! FAOS 4,7 ff. (chapterI), with textreferences (see howeverthe review articles). Among the texts published

after McEwan’s study, the KislTmu ritual BM 32206 + is especially important for its additional information on priests and other temple personnel. Not attested elsewhere are the DUMU.NIG.LA.LA, possibly to be read

as mar saldti (see G. Cagirgan, W.G. Lambert, JCS 43-45 [1991-93], 90-1), and, although very uncertain,

the l}(ittaru (ib., 101).

105 por the occasional reading '“MA§.MA§ = masmassu instead of asipu in the Late Babylonian period see

my comment on TU 38, rev. 45, in the Appendix.

106 He is mentionedtogetherwith the lamentation priest, the singer and the craftsmen (in the colophon ofTU

38, rev. 45). He is also mentioned together with the lamentation priest and the singer in the Uruk New Year •

festival (TU 39, obv. 35; rev. 19) and he takes part in procession during this festival (TU 39, obv. 27, with

a temple enterer, TU 40, rev 6, 9, with the king; BUM 4, 7, passim, with the high priest, the temple enterer

and the brewers), and recites incantations (BRM 4, 7, passim). He also takes part in the festival ofIstar (TU

42 +, rev. 300. During the night vigil festivities he consecrates the Scepter, takes part in a procession with

the torch together with the head temple enterer, the lamentation priests and the singers, and extinguishes

the torch (TU 41, obv. 4, 33, rev. 19). He recites incantations during the eclipse ofthe moon ritual (BRM

4, 6, obv. 35 f.). Finally, he has a minor role in the kettledrum ritual and the building ritual, see II.5.3 and

II.6.3.

107 The exorcist consecrates the temple (RAcc., 140, 340 ff.) and recites incantations (RAcc., 141, 355).

1.3. The cult

of dirges (galamabu / kalamabhu).^^'^ The kettledrum ritual and the building rituaino

belong to the text corpus ofthe lamentation priest (fo2/w^M).Di

The same is true for the cultic performers assirmuja^garm^d^ dhe

diviner performing extispicy (baru) is not well attested in the Hellenistic period, which

however is not a result of Greek influence, but must be explained by the fact that m t e

Hellenistic period divination was to a large ex^Llgglaced by^toolog;^ McEw^^

suggested.D6 This is confirmed by the fact that most ofthe texts in which the diviner is

mSiti^d are in all probability Hellenistic copies of older originals.

Finally, the texts often mention the erib bXti ‘temple enterer’, i.e. a person w o

is allowed to enter the restricted areas of the temple.D7 As Bongenaar convincingly

argued, 'erib blti is not a general word, class, position or honorific title, but hasjust one

meaning: “the owner of an erib bltutu prebend’”.Anyone who held certain offices- or had to perform certain duties in the temple owned an erib bltutu prebend. It is

therefore no surprise to find that ‘priests’, and also those experts and craftsmen who

were needed inside the temple to perform their duties, such as the goldsmith (Mimmu),

the carpenter (naggdru), the jeweller (kabsarru), the seal-cutter (purkullu), and the

craftsman (gwrgwrrw), were called erib brri. . . The fact that a person designated as cook/baker (nubatimmu), brewer (sirasu) oil

processor (sahitu), butcher (tabibu), or miller (ararru) is sometimes also called erib biti,

does not conliadict Bongenaar’s theory. Obviously a cook or butcher only delivered his

goods and his work did not require admission into the restricted parts ofthe teniple, but

this does not mean that he did not hold other offices or perform other tasks which did

make it necessary for him to enter the temple.n^ The fact that the erib biti is sometimes

I. Introduction

mentioned together with other priests or craftsmen is not surprising either, because in

these cases the erib bTtis are always mentioned as being the last in line, and should be

interpreted as ‘the (other) erib bTtis’. This is confirmed by the ritual textBRM 4,7, which

describes a procession ofAnu from the Res-temple to the a^z7M-temple. After Anu has

left the cella Enamenna and has arrived at the Grand Gate, the high priest {ahu rabu), the

exorcists, the (other) erib bTtis, and the brewers recite a prayer. This is repeated during

the different stages ofthe procession until they reach the aAfrw-temple.i^o Because Anu,

has left the restricted temple area, the brewers, mentioned after the erib bTtis because

they are not allowed to enter the temple, can join in as bearers of the carrying pole

As we saw, the colophon of TU 38 presents us with a list of priests and craftsmen

who perform cultic proceedings in the temples: it mentions the ritual activities of the

exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers and the craftsmen (DUMU.MES um- man-nu).^^^ Together with the high priest (not mentioned in the colophon), these are the

persons who are most often mentioned in the temple ritual texts, and who are responsible

for performing the ceremonies and rituals. However, there is one other person, who also

takes part in cultic activities on certain occasions: the king.

The king

We have many references to the king in the temple ritual texts. His tasks in the public

cult (called the sakke sarrutu the ‘ritual regulations of kingship’) are referred to in the

description ofthe Uruk cult in the colophon of TU 38.^22 The additional offerings ofthe

king {tardTt sarri), mentioned in a list of offerings and ceremonies in TU 38 form part

ofthese ritual regulations.!23 Furthermore the king takes part in the New Year festivals

in Uruk and Babylon,!24 participates in the special festival for Istar of Uruk,!25 recites

ersemsahungu-pmyQYS in the Uruk building ritual,!26 and appears in the last part ofthe ^

lunar eclipse ritual in Uruk. !27

The question is whether in the Hellenistic period the Macedonian kings participated

in the cult activities in the same manner as did the Babylonian and Achaemenid kings

in the previous periods. The temple ritual texts do not give us any information on this,

but non-cultic sources, especially chronicles, building inscriptions and the astronomical

diaries suggest that this is the case, and for a good reason too. As Sherwin-White and

Kuhrt stated: ‘in Babylonia (...) the Seleucid kings present a coherent picture of rulers

who are no foreign enemy but constitute a legitimate and just dynasty, attuned to local

gods and actively participating in cults. Here, the tradition ofBabylonian kingship gave

ofthe temple enterer in the Day One temple i.e. the afe'/w-temple in Arsacid Babylon, which shows that the ^

cult was still practiced in the first century B.C. The temple enterer is also mentioned in the Rahimesu-text

1.3. The cult

king and subject a framework to operate in. (...) The Seleucid kings seem effectively to

have taken on, and could be felt to have fulfilled, some aspects oftheir Achaemenid and

Babylonian inheritance’.!2S

The involvement of the Macedonian kings with the Babylonian temples has been

described by Van der Spek!29; Alexander started to restore Esagila in Babylon ^djiis

successors also undertook building renovations on the temples ofUruk ^-i^d Habylqn.!^

ATmll be'nTustfat^^in the following^apters, many references in the astronomical

diaries indicate the active participation of the Macedonian king, or of high officials

acting as his representatives, in the official cult in the temples, performing offerings and

ceremonies or taking part in the New Year festival. The reason for this participation

is religious (the king is representative of the people, honoring the gods and seeking

support, advice and protection from danger from the gods for himself and his subjects),

political (legitimation of his position, seeking support and goodwill from his people),

and economic (using the wealth ofthe temples to provide an income for himself and to

subsidize military campaigns).

Van der Spek describes the role of the king as the benefactor ofthe temples, who

hopes to find moral arid financial support for his political and military plans, but also as

the robber oftemple funds in times of crisis. On religious matters however the temples

were usually left in peace. We do find in the astronomical diaries many references to

special rituals which were held for one or more gods and ‘for the life of the Idng

and his royal family. These were not necessarily imposed on the temples by the king,

but may have developed spontaneously in the cities of the Seleucid empire, including

Babylonia. The rituals for the king are usually referred to as ruler cults and are discussed

elsewhere.

Cult terminology

In the texts from Mesopotamia we find a wide range of general terms referring to the

cult and to its different elements, e.g. ‘ceremony (rite), ritual, ritual procedure/actiyity,

festival’ etc. Unfortunately most of these terms apparently have a general meaning:

clear definitions are not given and the context often does not give us enough clues to

distinguish one term from another.!^2 We will list these terms here and discuss their

relevance for the Hellenistic period.

A general word, attested from the Old Babylonian period on, isparsu ‘rite, cult’, written

syllabically but also with the Sumerograms GARZA and ME. The former originally

stood for ‘cult practice, rite’, and ME for ‘divine power, divine order , two different

meanings which, according to Landsberger, assimilated into the Akkadian33 We

have many examples from Hellenistic ritual texts. Parsu, usedas a more general reference

to the entire cult, is attested in a passage from TU 38, where after the enumeration of

several offerings and ceremoniestiie textstatesthat these are ‘written down in (the tablets

of) the rites for the whole year’ {sd ina GARZA sd kal MU.AN.NA sat-ri).^^^ Here the

rites ofthe divine marriage (GARZA.GARZA ha-sd-du) are also mentioned,i35 and the

colophon ofthis text begins with the rites for the Anu-worship (GARZA ^\Ji-u-tu)I^^

The term parsu is also used in texts describing the New Year festivals from Uruk^^'^

and Babylon,i38 and in a kettledrum ritual text from Uruk, referring to someone who

is not responsible for the rites. In this ritual we also find parsu used in combination

with kidudu ‘ritual’ the bull is taken to be used for the rites and rituals {a-na par-si u

KI.DU.DU-i/e-e).i4i We also have one reference in an eclipse ofthe moon(?) ritual, but

the context is difficult. Finally parsu is (rarely) recorded in the astronomical diaries

from Babylon,

nepesu ‘ritual, ritual procedure’, often used in the plural {nepesu), is especially well- known from the Neo-Assyrian period on, and is usually written syllabically. It is also

mentioned in Hellenistic ritual texts, Many times it is attested in the phrase ne-pe-si

sd i^GALA ‘(This is) the ritual procedure ofthe lamentation priest’, used to identify

the ritual or a recitation, performed during a ritual, as belonging to the text corpus of

the lamentation priest {kalutu).^^^ Furthermore, nepesu is known from the kettledrum

7. Introduction

A general term for ‘festival’ is isinnu, a word which goes back to the Old Babylonian

period, and can refer both to a religious and a secular festival. Although a general use

ofisinnu is also known, more often it concerns a special festival identified by the name

of a god, a temple or a month. A special case is the festival ofthe New Year {isinnu

aldtu)!^ In the Hellenistic period isinnu is not attested in ritual texts. However, we

have two occurrences in other texts, both referring to special festivals. First, in the ritual

calendarSBHVIII, II, 7; here isinnu probably refersto the aAiifM-festival ofthe first month

Nisannu in Babylon. The second reference is recorded in an Arsacid administrative

text from Babylon, AB 248,^66 which refers to day 25 of Simanu on which a temple

festival ofEsabad is celebrated.

Finally we should mention nigutu ‘music, festival’, not known from Hellenistic ritual

texts, but attested in the chronicle texts.From the astronomical diaries we know that

it was still used in the Arsacid period. 1^9

II. CEREMONIES, RITUALS AND FESTIVALS

II.l. Introduction

Important elements of the cult are the ceremony, the ritual and the religious festival.

A ceremony is a religious custom or rite for the opening or continuation of contact

between man and the divine. The ceremony, together with the seasons (with which it

was originally closely connected), was the basis for the chronology of the cultic year:

the fixed days ofthe months, on which the ceremonies had to be performed, resulted in

a calendar which was based on the cult.

Rituals and festivals consist of a complex of ceremonies, each of which have their

own function, combined together to serve a different purpose. In general this purpose

consists in averting evil which may threaten an individual or the community, by following

a'fixed set of rules which describe how humans must serve the gods and in return enjoy

a secure and pleasant life.

The Mesopotamians offered mythological explanations for the cultic activities in

the ritual texts. According to the Mesopotamians a ritual is often a re-enactment of a

myth, because, as Lambert noted, they considered myths not to have happened once in

a remote past, but were regarded to occur at regular intervals.^ It is often difficult for us

to assess how the Mesopotamians conceived a ritual to be connected with a particular

myth. Sometimes the ritual itself contains an explanation. We also have explanatory

texts which ‘explain’ some of these connections.^ As Livingstone concluded, because

for the Mesopotamians there is no fundamental difference between myth and ritual, the

statues and symbols which are used in the temple rituals are in fact the deities which

they represent, and the rituals in which they take part are therefore myths. These myths

usually deal with struggles between major deities, which are derived from mythological

events described in the epics Enuma elis and Anzu. People mentioned in the rituals

correspond to victorious deities in the myths, while animals or objects correspond to

defeated deities or demons.^

In texts from Mesopotamia we find no clear definition of a ceremony. We do have an

interesting enumeration of several ceremonies from Uruk in TU 38, which describes

the amount of foodstuffs and drinks which have to be brought into the temples daily.^

> See W.G. Lambert, JSS 13 (1968), 104ff., especially 112. A good example of a ritual explained by a

, myth is the kettledrum ritual, see II.5.2. For a survey ofthe history and development ofthe myth and ritual

debate i.e. what came first, the myth or the ritual, see H.S. Versnel, Transition and reversal in myth and

ritual, Leiden, New York, Koln, 19942 (Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman religion II. Studies in Greek

and Roman religion, vol. 6, II), chapter I, 15-88.

2 The explanatory texts explaining temple rituals by equating them with myths are discussed by A. Living

stone, Mystical, 115 ff. (chapters 4-6). See also 1.2.

5 Mystical, 115 and 169f.

The text is discussed in III.2.2.

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

Obv. 35-38 mentions loaves and date cakes which are used for several offerings and

ceremonies:

‘35... Not included are (also) the large(?) loaves and the date cakes 36which are for the travel

provisions ofthe gods, the guqqu-o^Qungs, the ei5e5u-ceremonies, the opening ofthe gate

ceremonies, the clothing ceremonies, 3?the holy water (basin) ceremonies, the night vigil

ceremonies, the brazier ceremonies, the rites of the divine marriage, (the offerings of) the

karibus 38and the additional offerings ofthe king’.

Apart from four groups of general offering gifts,^ the loaves and date cakes are also

intended for several ceremonies listed here: the monthly-celebrated e55e5M-ceremonies,6

the daily-celebrated opening ofthe gate ceremonies (pit bdbi)P the monthly-eelebrated

clothing ceremonies (lubustu),^ the holy water (basin) ceremohies (egubbu), performed

during purifications,^ the monthly-celebrated night vigil eeremonies (bajjdtu),^^ the

brazier ceremonies (kiniinu),^^ and the rites ofthe divine marriage (jjasadu), performed

during the New Year festival, but also on other occasions.

The reverse (35-38) mentions oxen and sheep for the same list of offerings and

ceremonies (but without the travel provisions ofthe gods), and then adds (38-39):

‘which are written down in (the tablets of) the rites iparsu) for the whole year, in the Res- temple, the Esgal-temple, the Eanna-temple and the (other) temples ofTiranna (= Uruk) for

Anu, Antu and all the (other) gods’.

The list in these two passages is apparently an attempt to present a complete description

ofthe regularly recurring offerings and ceremonies during the cultic year in Uruk. This

is confirmed by the fact that the text refers to the marriage-rites, but not to the New

Year festival {akitu),^'^ nor to any other ritual or festival, which was celebrated only once

a year or on special occasions, e.g. the kettledrum ritual or the building ritual.xhe

text mentions the opening ofthe gate ceremonies, but not the awakening ofthe temple

ceremonies {dTk biti),'^^ which may be explained by the elose connection between these

ceremonies. Note that the night vigil ceremonies are mentioned, but not the closely

eonnected good-functioning of the temple ceremonies {saldm biti).^^ Because the list

on the obverse is identieal with the one on the reverse (with the exception ofthe travel

offerings ofthe karibus (see III.7.2), and the additional offerings ofthe king {tardltu sarri, see III.2.2 and

provisions ofthe gods, only mentioned in the former), the possibility ofthe slovenliness

ofthe writer can be excluded.

Because it is difficult to ascertain any logical schedule in the nature or sequence of

the ceremonies in this list,i7 in this chapter another order has been chosen: first we will

analyse the group whichhas a cyclical basis, i.e. which are performed on a daily, monthly

or yearly basis, although, as we will see, it is often difficult to determine whether we

are dealing with monthly or yearly ceremonies and rituals, or whether they occur on y

occasionally. Then a few special rituals are discussed: the kettledrum ntual, the building

ritual and the eclipse of the moon ritual. Finally we will analyse some festivals abou

which we know only little: a temple festival celebrated in Esabad, the temple ofGula m

Babylon, a so-called palm festival in Esagila, a ^an2-ritual in Esagila, a Greek festiva ,

two special festivals for Istar ofBabylon and Istar ofUruk respectively, and a noctoal

festival celebrated in the Res-temple eomplex. We will also diseuss the so-called Ruler

cults.

II.2. Daily ceremonies

The god was represented in the temple by an anthropomorphic statue, and therefore his

daily life was taken care of by humans in an anthropomorphic way: ceremonies and

rituals concentrated on the daily life in the temple and the meals which were served to

the gods. An important element ofthis daily practice was the divine meal, whicl^ill be

discussed in chapter III. Furthermore two ceremonies are known which were perfomed

every cultic day in the temples: the dTk blti- and the/?z7 ^aZ?z-ceremonies. They will be

discussed in this sectiop. But first we must briefly analyse the cultic day.

II.2.1. The cultic day

The Babylonian day {umu) was divided into seasonally varying watches {massarti^,

three during the day and three during the night, and into twelve unchanging doub e

hours’ (beru).^^ A normal day began and ended with sunset,20 between the first and last

17 According to G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS 4,163, the fact that kinmu follows bajlatum the

formertook place during the night vigils. However, this could be accidental. Furthermore, it is no ^ y

the list in TU 38 follows a chronological order, since in TU 39, obv. 13 it is stated that

follow the clothing ceremonies (lubustu), whereas in TU 38, obv. 36 and rev. 36-37 they are mentioned

It started at sunrise {napdhu sa samsi),^^ or more precise shortly before sunrise, during

the (last) double hour ofthe night {ber musi), before the gates ofthe temple were opened,

with the dTk bTti-ceremony. The cultic day ended, after the two evening meals were served

and cleared, with the closing ofthe gates. However, the beginning ofthe second cultic

day ofthe New Year festival, held in the month Nisannu in Babylon, began two hours

before dawn, i.e. the last double hour ofthe night and then began progressively earlier on

each succeeding day, the third probably (the text is damaged) 1/3 double hours earlier,

the fourth on 2/3 double hours earlier, until finally it began four hours before dawn, i.e.

two double hours ofthe night,26 either during the middle or during the last night watch

{Mt urri).'^'^

Cultic days, which included a night vigil {bajjdtu),^^ had a different schedule^^;

- the dTk bTti-CQTQmony

- the pTt bdbi-CQVQmony

- the serving and clearing ofthe two meals ofthe morning

- the serving (and clearing)30 oftwo meals ofthe evening

21 See LKU, no. 51, obv. 7, 21, 26, rev. 36; TU 39, rev. 23 (the time ofthe main and second meal), see my

comments on this line in the Appendix.

23 See TU 39, rev. 15 ff., describing the normal proceedings of day 11 ofthe New Year festival ofTagrTtu in

Uruk; at the end ofthe cultic day there is no mention ofthe closing ofthe gate but the text states (rev. 23-4):

‘The main and second (meal) ofthe (last) double hour ofthe day in the usual manner ditto’, referring to the

end of day 10 (rev. 14).

24 See also m.2.1.

ritual BRM 4, 6, rev. 31; see also the kettledrum ritual KAR 50, rev. 2 (Neo-Assyrian). 25 RAcc., 129,1; 132,157; 133,217; 136,285.Cf. G.IP. McEwan,i?4d5'4,171. See now also the Hellenistic

27 In Babylon for halfthe year the night lasts less than 12 hours. This night was still divided into 3 watches,

each ofless than 4 hours (= 2 beru). Ifsomething occurred 2 beru before sunrise then dming this half ofthe

year it could not have occurred during the last watch, but during the middle watch. At the equinoxes (when

day and night were realy equal to 6 beru each) 2 beru before simrise is (ideally) at the beginning ofthe last

watch ofthe night {sat urri). For the sat urri, the third and last watch ofthe night i.e. the morning watch, see

also TU 48 (discussed in II.2.2), obv. 18.

28 See also II.3.4 and II.8.6.

29 See TU 39, rev. 3 ff., describing days 9 and 10 ofthe New Year festival ofTasiitu in Uruk; the beginning

of day 9, with the dTk blti- and thepit babi-ceremonics and the serving ofthe first morning meal, is lost.

30 Tij 41^ obv. 13 informs us that the meal is not cleared, the vigil continues the entire night, and the gate is

not closed (that is: notyet closed at the beginning ofthe evening, as on a normal cultic day).

26

IL2. Daily ceremonies

- the night vigil

- the closing ofthe gate

On the following day:

- the dTk Z)r//-ceremony

- the pTt ba.bi-CQiQVQ.ony

- the end ofthe night vigil

The vigil (which was the last cultic event ofthe cultic day) started after the serving and

clearing ofthe two meals ofthe evening, and ended not when the gate was closed at the

end of the night, but on the next day, after the dTk bTti- and pTt babi-CQVQmomQS were

performed.

In the ritual texts we also find other references to the time of day or night when a

certain part of a ritual had to be performed. The New Year text from Babylon mentions

cultic activities taking place after 1, 1 1/2, and 1 2/3 double hours of daytime have past

{ber umu isqd).'^'^ In two cases the texts refer to the evening watch i.e. the first watch of

the night {bararTtu).^^ More often, however, the texts are less specific, referring to dawn

{namanijP to the late afternoon {sa kTs umi, lit, ‘that ofthe cool of the day’),^"^ to the

evening {iTldtu),^^ or to the night {musu).^^

II.2.2. dTk bTti .

The first cultic ceremony of the day was the dTk bTti ‘awakening of the temple

ceremony.37 It was performed during the last night watch, just before the end of the

night vigil, before dawn, and before the gates were opened. The ceremony is attested in

text^ from the Neo-Assyrian and the Hellenistic periods. The function ofthe ceremony

is never explicitly described, but probably the ‘awakening’ or ‘arousing’ ofthe temple

refers to both the residents of the temple, the gods, and the priests, who have to wake

up the gods to start a new day. The dTk bTti-QQiQVQOQy was probably performed at the

beginning of every cultic day, and was not a ceremony for special occasions. Although

31 RAcc., 132, 190 (1 1/2 double hours) for the third day; 140, 338 (1 double hour) and 141, 366 (1 2/3

double hours) for the fifth day.; see my comments on line 190 in the Appendix. For references to the morning

sat Mm’(EN.NUN.UD.ZAL.LA) ‘in the morning watch’; in TU 39 the dlk ferfi-ceremony is attested for days

7 (not 6), 10 and 11 ofTasiitu.

27

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

it is not clear how exactly the ceremony was performed, we know that an important

element ofthe ceremony was the reciting oflamentations {taqribtu and ersemakku) for

the most important gods ofthe pantheon.

Important evidence for the dlk biti-cevemony comes from three texts, which indicate

that there was a fixed liturgy involving the to^nZ?/M-lamentations for certain days of

each month; the purpose of reciting the lamentations was to ensure that any offence

(unknowingly) commited against the gods would be neutralized.^^ One text is TU 48, a

calendar text from Hellenistic Uruk. Very similar to this text are K 2724 +, a calendar

text from the Neo-Assyrian period, found in Assur, and BM 50503, a calendar text from

Neo-/Late Babylonian Sippar. All texts coneentrate on the lamentation priests only,

leaving the activities of other priests aside.39 We will start with the text fi"om Assur.

K2724 +

The Neo-Assyrian text K 2724 + lists lamentations recited to Assur in the city Assur in

the temple of Dagan and in Esarra (but also lamentations recited to Ninlil (Mullissu),

Marduk and Istar).'^^ The lamentations were recited by the lamentation priest. The text

apparently began with the month Tasrltu.^i The preserved portion ofthe text describes

the liturgy firom Sabatu up to the eleventh day of Nisannu. The relevant passage in K

2724 + reads42;

As in the kettledrum ritual and building ritual texts, see II.5.3 and II.6.3.

‘*0 Probably the ceremony was also performed for the other great gods, since A 485 + (E. Ebeling, OrNS 21

(1952), 135-141. Cf B. Menzel, Tempel, no. 28), rev. 19-24 lists the gods who followed A§sur in the temple

ofDagan, but without the recitation oflamentations. See also TU 48 below.

the taqribtu (and) “May it appease his heart”, the ersemakku to Assur in the temple of

Thus, a dik biti-CQTQmony is attested for days 22, 23,24 and (25) of Sabatu for Assur in

the the temple ofDagan:

- on day [22] of Sabatu: the taqribtu UMUN.SE.ER.MA.AL.LA AN.KI.A and the

ersemakku DILMUN NIGIN.NA are recited in Esarra, and then, after the procession

ofAssur from Esarra to the temple ofDagan, the taqribtu NIUTU.GIN E.TA and the

ersemakku U.LI.LI EN.ZU SA.MAR.MAR are recited during the awakening ofthe

temple ceremony; - on day 23 of Sabatu: the taqribtu UR.SAG.GAL ME.NI SE.ER.MA.AL.LA tL.LA

and the ersemakku AN.NAZA.E MAH.ME.EN are recited. After the sheep offerings

the taqribtu UD.DAM KI AM.MU.US and the ersemakku UMUN.BARA.KU.GA

are recited during the awakening ofthe temple ceremony;

- on day 24 of Sabatu: the taqribtu E.LUM BAR.RA ME.A and the ersemakku

NAM.MU.UN.SUB.BE.EN are recited. After the sheep offering the taqribtu AM.E

AMAS.A.NA and the ersemakku UR.SAG ABZU.TA are recited during the awak

ening ofthe temple ceremony;

- on day 25 of Sabatu: the taqribtu S]IPA ZI.DA EDIN.NA.RA and the ersemakku

ALIM.MA UMUN.GIR.[RA] are recited. After the sheep offering the taqribtu

[A.AB.BA] HU.LUH.HA of Marduk and the ersemakku SA.BA.NI GA.AN.HUN

are recited during the awakening ofthe temple ceremony.

These taqribtus and ersemakkus are recited ‘after the sheep offering(s)’, as the text

states. However, it is nor clear whether the lamentations recited before these offerings.

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

also belong to the dikZ^fft'-ceremony, or form a separate ceremony. The latter is suggested

by day 22, where lamentations are recited in two different temples.

BM50503

This text from Sippar, which was only recently published by Stefan Maul,44 was

according to the latter probably written during the late 8th and late 6th century B.C. It

consists of a cultic calendar for Samas, Aja and Bunene in Ebabbar, with lamentations

and ritual instructions for four days: the first day is not indicated, but must be one ofthe

first seven days ofthe month, since the second day indicated is the 8th, followed by the

15th and the 20th. The first day on which the lamentations were recited is probably day

1, as Stefan Maul convincingly argued.45 The month during which these cultic activities

are performed is the first month ofthe year (Nisannu), but the last lines ofthe text make

it clear that the instructions also had to be used for the rest ofthe year.46

During these four days taqribtus and ersemakkus are to be recited for Samas before

sunrise, during the dik Z?rh-ceremony, and before sunset {lam iTldti). Here we will

concentrate on the lamentations recited during the dik Z)rf/-ceremony47;

- on day 1(?!) of every month: the taqribtu ABZU PE.EL.LA.AM, and the ersemakku

DILMUNNIGIN.NA;

- on day 8 of every month: the taqribtu U4.DAM KI AM.MU.US, and the ersemakku

UMUN BARA KU.GA;

- on day 15 of every month: the taqribtu AM.E AMAS.A.NA, and the ersemakku

UR.SAG ABZU.TA;

- on day 20 of every month: the taqribtu U4.DE U4.DE, and the ersemakku UR.SAG

UT.Ui8.LU.

The text presents us with clear evidence that the dik Z?fri-ceremony was performed before

dawn {ina seri).'^^

TU 48

In a liturgical calendar text from Hellenistic Uruk,49 TU 48, we also find a schedule

ofhymns to be recited with various offerings associated with the dlk Z?rh‘-ceremony for

various days, performed by lamentation priestsin the Ubsukkinaku, the central courtyard

in the Res-complex, in front ofthe Anu-Antu-temple.^o

49 The owner ofthe tablet, Maimu-iqapu, son of Anu-iqisanni ofthe family Sin-leqe-unninni is, as far as I

know, not attested elsewhere. The colophon refers to him as ‘apprentice lamentation priest’, indicating that

the text belongs to the corpus ofthe Lamentation priest. The text was probably found in the Res-temple area,

along with other rC/-texts, see 1.2.

60 Note that the activities ofthe lamentation priest in Uruk, as described in TU 48, are referred to in another

Uruk text from an earlier date, LKU, no. 51 (see 1.2), which not only describes offerings and ceremonies

II.2. Daily ceremonies

Several taqribtus are listed on the obverse. The accompanying ersemakkus are not

mentioned, but they were probably also recited together with their taqribtus.In obv.

Furthermore, in cycle B, the lamentation priests had to perform, during the dik blti- ceremony, /a^nTj^w-lamentations for the 1st, 7th, 15th and (20th) ofevery month, as well

as special .yearly recitations on the 14th and 18th of the month Arahsamna, this was

done ‘in the morning watch’ {ina sat urri), as the text specifically states for day 1 (obv.

18), but most likely this also applies to days 7,15 and (20):

cycle B (obv. 18-rev. 10):

- every month on the 1st day: dUTU.GIN7 E.TA to Anu

- every month on the 1st day: E.LUM DI.DI.RA to the gods (ofthe night?)

- every month on the 7th day: UD.DAM KI AM.MU.US to Anu

- every month on the 7th day: E.NE.EM.A.NI I.LU to the gods (ofthe night?)

- every month on the 15th Say: AM.ME AMAS.A.NA to Anu

- every ihonth on the 15th day: AN E.LUM.MA to the gods (ofthe night?)

3 special recitations:

- on the 14th day (ofArahsamna): AB.GIN7 GU.DE.DE to Belet-sa-Uruk (= Istar)

- on the 14th day (ofArahsamna): URU.yUL.AM.KE4 to Nanaja

- on the 18th day ofArahsamna: A.AB.BA yU.LUIJ.IIA to Anu.

- (every month on the 20th day).^'^

After day 1, 7 and 15, we go back to day 14, apparently of Arahsamna, as in rev. 9.

Rev. 7-8 refers neither to the dik bfri-ceremony nor to the month Ara^isamna, but the

text is not without mistakes. The text gives in chronological order the days on which

the taqribtu-lsLiriQntations had to be recited every month, interrupted by lamentations

on special days: first, in obv. 1-17, day 1, 2 and 7 of every month, followed by day

1, 2 and 15 of Nisannu; then picking up the chronological order with day 15 and 20

of every month. Secondly, in obv. 18-rev. 10 (during the dik Z>fft-ceremony), day 1, 7

and 15 of every month, followed by day 14 and 18 of Arahsamna; then picking up

the chronological order with day 20, which however is not written since the text is

67 G.J.P. McEwan {FAOS 4,172, n. 404) already noted that, since the text says it is not complete (rev. 10), is

it likely that the original tablet contained a separate entry concerning the lamentations performed during the

dik Zifri-ceremony for the 20th of each month.

33

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

incomplete. Two lamentations on the 14th of every month after one lamentation on the

15th is not likely. First of all it would contradict the chronology ofthe whole text. Also,

ifthe 14th and 15th were alternative days, one would expect Anu (the most important

god of Hellenistic Uruk) to be celebrated first, and so the 14th would be dedicated to

Anu, and the 15th to Istar; compare the other alternative days in obv. 1-4, where the 1st

day is dedicated to Anu, the 2nd to Istar. Therefore the two lamentations on the 14th are

probably special lamentations for Arahsamna, together with the following lamentation

on the 18th (rev. 9).

However, because in the textthere is no reference to Arahsamna, McEwan considered

day 14 to refer to every month.^^ He suggested that the second day for every month in

cycle A, dedicated to Istar, is an alternative day for the 1st day, dedicated to Anu, and

the 14th day in cycle B, dedicated to Istar, referring to every month, is an alternative

day for the 15th, dedicated to Anu. All the other days refer to both gods at the same

time. Based on this he deduced a different cultic pattern for the Res-temple ofAnu and

Antu, and the Esgal-temple ofIstar and Nanaja: (a) to^rz^fw-lamentations to Anu in the

Res-temple on days 1,7,15 and 20, and to Istar in the Esgal-temple on days 2, 7,15 and

20. (b): ^<2^nh?M-lamentations during the dTk hrh-ceremony to Anu in the Res-temple on

days 1, 7, 15 and (20), and to Istar in the Esgal-temple on days 1, 7,14 and (20).

We must conclude that, since day 14 is not an alternative day for day 15, the two

cultic patterns of Anu in the Res-temple and Istar (and Nanaja) in the Esgal-temple

differ from each other on only one day, the lst/2nd.

McEwan identifies the four monthly festivals in TU 48, celebrated on the lst/2nd, 7th,

15th and 20th days, with the monthly recurring clothing ceremony (lubustu) and the often

coimected hitpu-oflQrings.^^ His first argument is that TU 48, obv. 14 refers to lubustu.

Unfortunately the data for the days on which lubustu is celebrated in the Neo-Babylonian

and Hellenistic periods do not exactly match the days ofTU 48.^0 Furthermore, McEwan

argues, we know that the hitpu-oflciings in the Neo-Babylonian period were made on

four regular recurring days, for which also alternative days are attested. But again, these

days also do not exactly match the days mentioned in TU 48.'^^ However, we must keep

in mind that, apart from TU 48, we have only one more dated reference to lubustu

from the Hellenistic period; from the Neo-Babylonian period we have more, but we

caimot exclude the possibility that major changes concerning lubustu may have occured

after the Neo-Babylonian period. So, although McEwan may be right, the only certain

reference in TU 48 to lubustu is the one on day 20 of every month (obv. 14). Whether

the other days refer to lubustu cannot (for now) be established with certainty.

Comparing the three texts, we find that TU 48 is in many ways very similar to K 2724

+ and BM 50503:

68 Although he also noted the ‘generally laconic nature ofthe text’, cf. FAOS 4, 172-3, with n. 405.

69 FAOS A, 173.

II.2. Daily ceremonies

1. TU 48, BM 50503 and K 2724 + deal with all the months, although the Assur-text

only mentions the months Sabatu, Addaru and Nisannu. The latter text is not complete,

however. Apparently the Assur- and Sippar-texts have a different cult schedule for every

month, while the Uruk-text uses one month as the model for the entire year; the days

referred to in BM 50503 (l[?!]-8-15-20) and TU 48 (1-7-15-20) are similar, but not

completely identical. The dfk hz7z-ceremony is used in both K 2724 + and TU 48 with the

taqribtu-lamQntations ^^UTU.GINv E.TA,’^^ UD.DAM KI AM.MU.US"^^ and AM.E/ME

AMAS.A.NA,74 although for different days. Furthermore, TU 48 has the same taqribtu

for the first day of every month as BM 50503, ABZU PE.EL.LA.AM,75 but in the latter

text not during the dlkhf/z-ceremony (here instead^UTU.G^?E.TA), while the taqribtus

for days 8 and 15 in the BM-text (U4.DAM KI AM.MU.US and AM.E AMAS.A.NA)

are performed in TU 48 during the dik hz7z-ceremony on days 7 and 15.76 interestingly

enough we have other texts, for instance the building rituals TU 45 and 46,77 which

enumerate lamentations, but do not mention the specific days and month on which they

had to be recited; they only state: ‘in an auspicious month, on a favourable day’ {ina ITI

sal-mu ina UD SE.GA).

2. Two taqribtu-lamQntations, which are attested in TU 48 (rev. 1 and 6), are also

mentioned in the New Year ritual TU 39 from Uruk. In this text the dlk hfrz-ceremony

is attested for 3 days of the month TasrTtu, although we must assume that the dlk blti- ceremony was performed every cultic day. The first seven days ofthe New Year festival

are presented in a very abbreviated version, with only one remark on day 6 {TU 39,

obv. 6) and a few short remarks on day 7 (obv. 7-15), including a reference to the dlk

hfrz-ceremony (obv. 7); it was performed by the lamentation priests (as in TU 48), but

no lamentation incipits are enumerated. In the same line the cook {nuhatimmu) is also

mentioned; although he is not referred to as one ofthe performers ofthe ceremony, it

may indicate that, similar to the pit hahz-ceremony (see below), foodstuffs were used

during the ceremony {TU 39, obv. 7-10)^

‘9Day 7: the awakening ofthe temple ceremony (performed) by the lamentation priests and

the singers. (As to) the cook: food and songs ofjubilation, ^roasted meat, beef and mutton for

the regular offerings, all sorts offine beer, ^including drawn wine and milk, date confection,

fine mixed beer and /ah^bz-mixed beer, iozzrzmZ«-cups(?), dannu- and nambaru-v^Xs (shaped

like) raven(?) for Papsukkal and Guskinbanda’.

Days 8 to 11 are described extensively. Although the beginning of day 8 is preserved

{TU 39, obv. 16ff.) and the pit hahz-ceremony is mentioned, the dlk hz7z-ceremony is,

strangely, not referred to here. The beginning of day 9 is lost. The dlk blti ceremony

is also mentioned for the last two days ofthe festival: on day 10 the dlk hfrz-ceremony

is performed by reciting the ta^rz^z^zz-lamentations UMUN SE.ER.MA.AL AN.KI.A

and AN E.LU4.UM.MA {TU 39, rev. 10-11). The latter is also attested in TU 48 (rev.

6) for the 15th day of every month. On day 11 the dik hrri-ceremony is performed by

reciting AM.E AMAS.AN.NA and E.LUM DI.DI.RA {TU 39, rev. 15-16). The latter

is also attested in TU 48 (rev. 1) for the first day of every month. For day 10 and 11

the moment when the ceremony was performed is further indicated by ina miisi ‘in the

night’; for these days the text also records that the ceremony takes place shortly before

the pit babi-CQXQmony. This agrees with TU 48, where (as we already noted above) the

lamentations were recited ‘in the morning watch’ (obv. 18).

As Cohen noted, because on days 10 and 11 ofthe New Year festival an assembly of

the gods took place, in which the fate for next year was determined, the recitation ofthe

taqribtus and their ersemakkus in order to appease the anger ofthe gods was of great

importance.'^s

Thepit bdbi ‘opening ofthe gate’-ceremony is known from the Old Babylonian period

on.79 Although it remains unclear how exactly the ceremony was performed, we know

that the ceremony took place just before dawn in the temples, after the i/f^hfri-ceremony

and together they formed the beginning of all cultic activities inaugurating the new

day. We must assume that the pit bdbi-CQvemony (just like the dik ^f^i-ceremony) was

performed on every cultic day ofthe year. It was probably not a ceremony fqr special

occasions, nor was its first aim to let the people enter the temple on the occasion of a

feast, as suggested by Landsberger^o and Weidner,8i but rather the opening ofthe gate(s)

indicates the time in the morning when all the priests and craftsmen who had to perform

their usual duties in the temple {erib biti) were allowed to enter the temple.

From the pre-Hellenistic periods we have a few references to the day(s) on which e

ceremony was performed; a sheep is slaughtered on ® ^inin in ^e

hdhi-ceremony in KAJ 199.82 The ceremony is celebrated on the 4th of Ululu m the

letters LAS I, no. 285,83 and ABL 496,84 and on the 4th, 5th and 6th of Ululu m LAb i,

no. 287.85 The fourth month Du’uzu is identified as the ‘month of the opening of the

gate’ {arah pit bdbi).^^

Uruk

For the Hellenistic period pit babi is attested in several ritual texts from Uruk. The gate

referred to in texts from Uruk is the babu saAnuu Antu, i.e. the gate ofthe Anu-^tu- temple in the Res-complex.*? In TO 38 pit babi is one ofthe ceremomes enumerated m

the list ofceremonies.88 This text also informs usthatloaves and date cakes and oxen an

sheep are used during the ceremony.® In the ritual text TU 39-40 we have^estahons of

mr i-L-ceremoniesfor the 8th, 10th andllthdaysofthemonthTasn-tu.90Thebeginnmg

ofday 9, probably with thepit iaW-ceremony, is lost. As we already saw in *e previous

paramaph, the first seven days are presented in an abbreviated form. Althou^ the dik

L-reremony is mentioned for the 7th day, thepit MW-ceremony is not referred to here.

The pit fcahi-ceremony is also known from TV 41, describing special ceremoniestong Siheld during Lnight ofthe 16th and 17th ofTebetu(?).« When the night was

over, after all the necessary ceremonies were performed, the gate was opened and t

vigil ended.92 in BRM 4, 6, the pit babi-cQiQmony is performed on the day after th

Thepit 6a6/-ceremony is also known from other texts from Hellenistic

calendar texts (VAT 7816 and 781594) thepfr ^dW-ceremony is attested for days 4,6 and

In a legal document (a sale of erib bitiitu- and tabihutu-^iQhQnd shares) from Uruk,

J. Oppert, J. Menant, Doc.jur., no. 5 (BM 93004),97 we perhaps have a reference to the

pit bdbi-QQiQmony (obv. 13), but the reading is not certain:

If this reading is correct, then apparently part of the income of the erib bitutu- and

tdbihutu-TpxQhQndi consisted of foodstuffs, which were also used as offerings during,

and therefore associated with, the pit 6d6i-ceremony. This is quite possible, since the

foodstuffs which are mentioned here remind us of the date cakes and oxen and sheep,

used for (amongst others) thepit 6dZ>z-ceremony mentioned in TU 38.

Finally, thepit bdbi-CQXQmony is also attested in an astrological text from Hellenistic

Uruk, which concerns the zodiacal system,mo From the twelve signs ofthe zodiac eight

signs (Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer) are associated

with the opening ofthe gate ceremonies ofvarious gods. See the following schedule:

Leo (Abu) pit bdbi Enlil

Virgo (Ululu) pit bdbi Sin, Istar

Libra (TasrTtu) pit bdbi Sin, §amas, Istar, Anu, Enlil, Ea, Ningirsu

himself, says a prayer to Bel, and then performs the opening of the gate ceremony

(written: gisIG.MES BAD-^e) in Esagila.m2 Further on in the same text, on day 5, the

pit /?dZjz-ceremony is relferred to immediately after the essesu-ctremony, in a only partly

preserved speech of the high priest to the king.m3 Finally, the ritual text BM 32206 +

mentions at the beginning ofthe second column for the fourth day ofthe month KislTmu

thepit/jd/jz-ceremony, performed probably by the high priest.m4 Note that 2 days attested

in Babylon, day 4 ofNisannu and day 4 ofKislTmu, are also known in Uruk.

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

II.3. Monthly ceremonies

The twelve months ofthe Babylonian year lasted 29 or 30 days each and they began with

the first sighting ofthe crescent ofthe new moon in the evening. During every month

special ceremonies were celebrated which were connected with certain fixed days ofthe

month. See for example TU 38, which refers to a purification, the cleansing ofthe hands

ceremony (tebibtu qatif^^: it was celebrated every month (arhussu) on day 16 for Anu

and Antu, exactly as was a special yearly celebrated ceremony on day 16 ofthe tenth

month Tebetu (rev. 32-34, see the Appendix):

‘32Qn day 16, monthly, 34(the priest) will offer 3210 first-quality sheep, fat (and) pure, whose

horns and hooves are perfect, 33for Anu and Antu of Heaven and the 7 planets, as cooked

meat, on occasion of34the cleansing ofthe hands ceremony (te-bi-ib-tu^ SU^^), in the Baramah

on the temple tower ofAnu, just like on day 16 ofTebetu’.

Some monthly ceremonies are only identified by the name(s) of the god(s) for which

the ceremony is celebrated. Other monthly ceremonies which are attested in the texts

are specifically named {essesu, lubustu, bajjdtu, nubattu, saldm bTti); it is usually not

specifically stated that they were performed monthly and the days are also often not

mentioned in the Hellenistic period. However, as we shall see, it is clear from texts

of earlier periods and from the context in which they appear that they were monthly

ceremonies. Also, we have an indication that a regular pattern of days used for cult

activities was in practice in Hellenistic Babylon: an astronomical diary states that on

days 1, 3, 7, 15, and 16 ofthe twelfth month Addaru a ritual procedure {nepesu) was

performed, for which mahhuru-o&Qvmgs were presented {mah-hu-ru un-dah-hi-ru).^^^

On the obverse ofthe tablet the eleventh month is discussed, and here we Jtod a ritual

procedure of the gods {ne-pes sd DINGIR.MES), for which mahhuru-o^Qrmgs are

also presented; the passage continues with a reference to the chief singer of dirges,

who recites(?) ersahungu-XdiblQts. Whether these two ritual procedures are identical is

difficult to say, because of the damaged state of the passages. Nevertheless, the days

mentioned here remind us of the days attested for the monthly ceremonies discussed

here; although the name ofthe ritual procedure is lost, one ofthe above-named monthly

ceremonies seems a likely candidate.

We will begin this section by describing the known unspecified monthly ceremonies

and then turn our attention to the monthly celebrated ceremonies which are known by a

specific name: essesu, lubustu, bajjdtu, nubattu, saldm biti.

Most of the unspecified monthly ceremonies come from legal documents concerning

prebend shares.Several unnamed monthly ceremonies for Anu, Antu, Enlil, Istar,

Nanaja, Belet-sa-Res, Belet-mati, Belet-seri, Papsukkal, and also for the statues ofthe

kings, are attested in the Hellenistic prebend texts from Uruk. The reference to the

monthly recurring character of a ceremony is presented in several different ways, which

we will illustrate with a few examples.

1. A ceremony can be referred to without a date or any other further specification. In

OECT 9, 42,111 obv. 12, before two aimual ceremonies for Papsukkal and Antu,n2 a

monthly ceremony for Enlil and Istar is mentioned, but no reference is made to the

monthly recurring character ofthis ceremony, and a specific day is also not indicated.

2. In OECT 9,45, obv. 10 // 46, obv. 9,H3 before two annual ceremonies for Papsukkal

and Antu, a monthly ceremony for Enlil is celebrated, this time on the monthly recumng

essesu-days^^‘^:

legal documents concerning prebend shares are from Uruk, see L.T. Doty, CAHU, 119-138; GJ.P McEwan,

FAOS 4, 67-120; B. Funck, Urukzur Seleukidenzeit, 56-277. So far no prebend documents from Babylon

are kno^, but we do have two deeds concerning bakers’ prebends from Nippur, see R.J. van der Spek, in;

3. Sometimes a text specifically statesthat the ceremony is celebrated arhussu ‘monthly’.

In OECT 9,68, * obv. 3-6, after a monthly ceremony for Enlil celebrated on the essesu- days, a monthly celebrated ceremony for Istar is mentioned, followed by an annual

ceremony for Antu:

4. A text sometimes not only states that the ceremony is celebrated monthly {arhussu),

but also mentions the specific day. In BRM 2, 36,“^ obv. 2—5, a ceremony for Anu on

day 27 of each month is recorded, together with a ceremony for the statues ofthe kings

on day 27 of each month:

II.3. Monthly ceremonies

5 Finally, the specific reference to the monthly character ofthe ceremony {arhussu) can

be left out, while the day ofthe month is mentioned. In J. Oppert, J. Menant, Doc. jur.,

no. 5 (BM 93004),“^ several monthly ceremonies (always without arhussu) for different

deities and one for the statues of the kings are mentioned. After a monthly ceremony

for Belet-mati, and another for Anu and Antu (obv. 9-13 “8), and before a monthly

ceremony for Nanaja on the essesu-dsys, and another for the statues ofthe kings on the

essesu-days (obv. 17-19), two monthly ceremonies are mentioned for Belet-seri on day

4 and for Papsukkal and Belet-seri on day 13, and furthermore a monthly ceremony for

Istar on day 3 (obv. 13-17):

When we examine these texts, we find that many are docnments concerning erib bit

piristutu-+kutimmutu-^iehQnd shares (i.e. concerning the office ofthe person authorized

to enter the secret room, and the goldsmith’s craft). 120 These prebends are coimected

because, as Doty noted, 121 the goldsmith (kutimmu) was responsible formaking, cleaning

and repairing the ornaments on the garments of the statues of the gods, which were

stored in the bit piristi, only accessible to the temple enterers {erib biti), and here

we find the reason why many of the uimamed monthly ceremonies are attested in

documents concerning erib bit piristutu- + kutimmutu-TprQhQVvA. shares: the income for

these prebends comes not only from uimamed monthly ceremonies, from a few annual

ceremonies, and the monthly e^^asw-ceremonies, but also from the monthly clothing

ceremonies {lubustu).

In all the texts the foodstuffs which are served on the offering table, and serve

as income for the prebend holders, primarify consist of meat of ox and sheep, with the

exception ofJ. Oppert, J. Menant, Doc.jur., no. 5 (BM 93004), which also mentions lamb

and duck, and furthermore records parched barley, takkasu-pastriQs, oil, and Dilmun

dates. Interestingly fowl is not mentioned, although it is attested for the unnamed annual

ceremonies. 122

Many ofthe texts also mention the e^^e^w-ceremony, discussed below: we find that

the unnamed monthly ceremonies do not refer to a specific day, when they are celebrated

on an essesu-day. When they are not celebrated on an essesu-day, then the specific day

is mentioned. Thus, in TS 15, 37, six ceremonies are mentioned, ofwhich four are dated

'*9 Cf. S. Sherwin-White, A. Kuhrt, From Samarkhand to Sardis, 224.

>20 OECT 9, 42, 44, 45 // 46, 50, 60, 68 and VS 15, 37. J. Oppert, J. Menant, Doc. jur., no. 5 contains a

sale of erib bitutu + tabihiitu-preheiid shares; BRM 2, 36, BiMes 24, 5, and 17 concern not further specified

prebend shares.

II.3. Monthly ceremonies

to a specific day, while the other two are celebrated on essesu-days. BRM 2, 36 only

dates two ceremonies to specific days. J. Oppert, J. Menant, Doc.jur., no. 5 (BM 93004)

dates five ceremonies to specific days, and two to the essesu-days.

II.3.2. essesu

essesu (written (UD) ES.ES) is a ceremony with a long history. 123 it is attested from

the Ur III period up to the Hellenistic period. 124 ES.ES is according to Jacobsen best

translated ‘all temple’ (ES = temple) or ‘“general” festival’ rather than ‘monthly festival’

and in the Ur III period it was celebrated in all the temples. i25 The ceremony was held on

days 1,7 and 15 ofeach month, corresponding to the phases ofthe moon. 126 Between the

Ur III and Old Babylonian periods, in texts from Ur, the number is raised to 4 by adding

day 25. Because this day cannot easely be connected with a phase of the moon, from

this moment on the essesu-days were apparently no longer linked to lunar phases.i27 in

the Middle Babylonian period the days were changed to days 4,8 and 17 of each month.

The Neo-Babylonianperiod

a While in Assyria an essesu-day as a ceremony is not attested, 128 in the Neo-Babylonian

period, especially in texts from Uruk, up to 11 days per month are connected with

essesu, but they almost never mention the specific dates ofthese days. We will give two

examples. The first is GCl, 209,129 a statement ofhoney used on essesu-days:

emmer,i47 sesame,^^^ barley,i49 and meat.i^o

In four texts from the Neo-Babylonian period we find that the eAse^w-ceremony is

connected with other ceremonies and offerings. In J. MacGinnis, AfO 38—39 (1991—92),

89 it is connected with the bajjatu-^^^ and salam Z?m‘-ceremonies,i52 and with the ginu-,

guqqu-, niqe sarri-, and niqe ^n'foi-offerings,^^^ inBIN 2,129 with the lubustu-, nabru- and Zjfl^d^M-ceremonies,^^^ in VS 6,268 also with the saldm biti- and bajjdtu-cQXQVHOviiQS,

and in GCl, 199 with the JbwwwM-ceremony.i^s The connection between the essesu- and

the salam Zjz7i-ceremony is clear from a Neo-Assyrian letter {LAS I, 280, rev. 16-18),

where the regular offerings (ginu) are presented, and incense is poured onto a censer on

the essesu-day (and?) at the salam 6m’-ceremony.

Although we must assume that the e^d^M-ceremony was performed during every

month of the year,^^^ only the months IV and VII/XI are attested in Uruk, and month

III in Babylon, which, however, is not surprising considering the small niimber oftexts

that we have. The number of e^^e^M-days, however, from one to eleven, is astonishing,

because in the earlier periods we know of only three or four. Were these ceremonies

celebrated for more than one god? Or is the month mentioned in the given text only

the first month for the essesu in question? This does not seem very likely. There is

another possibility: if, for example, we concentrate on the receipts of honey,i57 we see

that these texts have as their central topic not the e55e5M-ceremonies. The ceremonies

are mentioned only as secondary information, necessary to describe the amount ofthe

relevant foodstuff, needed for a certain month. So perhaps we should re-translate the

relevant section as: ‘PN has brought x honey (to the amount) of x me^w-offerings

(usually brought in) month x’. Because the actual days are almost never recorded (only the letter TCL 9,134 refers

to day 20), it remains unclear whether the same days from earlier periods were used or

not. One must assume that these days were well-known, and mentioning them was not

considered necessary. In any case, it becomes clear that, especially in Neo-Babylonian

Uruk, essesu was still a very frequently and regularly performed monthly ceremony.

II.3. Monthly ceremonies

The Hellenisticperiod

For the Hellenistic period the e^^e^w-ceremony is well attested, especially in texts from

Uruk. 158 However, the texts do not provide us with complete information because, as

in the Neo-Babylonian period, they never record the specific dates for the essesu-days,

again probably because they were well-known. This is confirmed by our list ofunnamed

monthly ceremonies from Hellenistic Uruk, discussed above, which are not specifically

dated when they are celebrated on an essesu-day. Ifthe days from earlier periods were

also used in the Hellenistic period, then we must, for example assume that the salam

biti- and 6q/ydfM-ceremonies, performed during the night ofthe sixteenth in Uruk, and

described in TU 41,159 were followed by an essesu-CQXomoviy on day 17, since this was

an essesu-dsy in earlier periods.

In prebend texts from Hellenistic Uruk the essesu-CQXQmony is attested many times,

often mentioned as a pair with the gw^^w-offerings, using the phrase:

sd ITI-M5-5M kal MU.AN.NA gu-uq-qa-ne-e UD.ES.ES.MES

‘monthly for the whole year, the guqqu- and ei^esM-offerings’.i^o

The commodities used for these ceremonies served substantially to provide an income

for the prebend holders. However, the composition of these commodities is almost

never described. Fortunately we have four prebend sales, which present us witlF some

information. In chronological order, the first text is OECT 9, 50, obv. 8-91^1:

From Babylon we have only one reference to the ceremony in the ritual text which

II.3.3. lubustu

The ritual clothing ceremonies of the divine statues (lubustuf^^ are attested from the

Old Akkadian period on.i^i The ceremony is not mentioned in Assyrian rituals,i72 but

it is attested in the letter LAS I, 285,where lubustu is celebrated on day 3-VI for

Bel. Lubustu is also recorded in administrative and ritual texts from the Neo-Babylonian

period.

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

The Neo-Babylonian period

In his dissertation, Bongenaar discussed the clothing ceremonies of Samas in Sippar.i'^^

BM 91002, a royal inscription of Nabu-apla-iddina (ninth century)!'^^ contains such

regulations for days 7-1, lO-II, 3-VI, 7-VII, 15-VIII and 15-XII of the year; thus six

ceremonies a year are listed. Bongenaar has demonstrated that these data are very similar

to the data found in Neo-Babylonian administrative clothing texts from Sippar.176 We

will compare these numbers with relevanttextsfromNeo-BabylonianUruk andBabylon.

The texts, all but one {ABL 496) from Uruk, are administrative documents with the

exception ofLKU, nos. 47 and 51, which are ritual texts and ABL 496, which is a Neo- Babylonian letter from Babylon, recording a lubustu for Bel on day 3-VI. Other gods

which are attested for the lubustu are Nergal for days 8-II; 17-IV; 28-X, Gula for day

24-VIII, and Aska’itu and Nergal for day 26-IX.^^2 Furthermore a lubustu for Samas

and Aska’itu is recorded.i83 For the clothing ceremonies, oil,i84 sesame,i85 wool,i86

sheep,’87 and finally payments,’88 silver for ^wrd5w-incense,’89 and lubaru-doXhing are

attested.’90

The evidence is scarce. From Uruk, especially informative is NCBT 1132, which

mentions 8-II, 17-IV, 24-VIII, 26-IX, 28-X, and day 16 of an unknown month. It does

not mention lubustu in month I and VI, as in Sippar, but it does mention month IV (also

in GC 1,242), IX (also in BIN 2,129) and X, which are not found in the Sippar calendar

in BM 91002 (referred to above). Furthermore, the ritual text LKU, no. 51 records the

first day of month X VI, and VII, and day 1, together with day 16 of month VI, is also

attested in BIN 1, 152. The days attested for the clothing ceremony in Uruk are very

different from the Sippar days, but they do not allow us to establish a clear monthly

schedule ofdays on which the ceremony was celebrated. Although lubustu is, as we will

see below connected with the ^frpw-offerings in prebend texts from Hellenistic Uruk,

which are performed on days 6/7, 13/14, 20/21 and 27/28 of each month, the attested

data for Neo-Babylonian Uruk do not match this ^zY/?M-sequence. It is clear, however,

that, while the ceremony was celebrated in Sippar during six months of the year, in

Neo-Babylonian Uruk eight months are attested; whether lubustu was celebrated during

every month remains unclear for now.

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

As we saw, the only reference from Babylon, ABL 496, mentions day 3-VI, which is

also attested in the letter LAS I, 285, and furthermore it is also one ofthe /w^w^fw-days

in Sippar. Obviously this is not enough to draw any conclusions as regards the data of

lubustu in Babylon, but it may be an indication that the /w^i/^^M-schedule in Babylon

was more similar to that in Sippar than to that in Uruk.

The Hellenisticperiod

While from Hellenistic Babylon no references to lubustu are known, the ceremony is

well attested in texts from Hellenistic Uruk.i^i xhe following gods are connected with

the clothing ceremony: Antu;i^2 Anu, Enlil, Nanaja and Belet-sa-Res;i93 Anu, Antu and

the great gods {ildnu rabutu);^^^ and Anu^^^ Apparently the ceremony was connected

with all, or at least with the more important gods ofthe pantheon ofUruk, and was not

confined to one god.

lubustu is one ofthe ceremonies recorded in a list of offerings and ceremonies in the

ritual text TU 38 (obv. 36, rev. 37), informing us that apparently loaves and cakes, and

oxen and sheep were used during the ceremony.

Another reference to the clothing ceremonies is recorded in TU 48, a cultic calendar

from Uruk, 196 which mentions day 20 of every month; this day is not attested in the

Neo-Babylonian period.

lubustu is also frequently mentioned in prebend texts from Hellenistic Uruk, but

the dates ofthe days are never recorded. OECT 9, 40,197 obv. 3 speaks ofthe clothing

ceremonies for every year:

2 ... mi-sil ina “^ZAG.LU UDU.NIt A M bi-it-pi.MES [...](?)

3 [M lu]-bu-sd-a-tu gab-bi sd An-tu^ sd gab-bi...

‘2 ... one half of the shoulder in the sheep of the Ai/pM-offerings [...](?) ^[of all the

clojthing ceremonies ofAntu for every year, all (ofit)...’.

All the relevant texts are erib bit piristutu- + kutimmutu-pTobQnd texts. 198 We already

noted199 that the reason for this is that the clothing ceremony is one of the income

198 OECT 9,42,45 // 46, 50, and 60. Other erib bitpiristutu + kutimmutu prebends do not mention lubustu,

but they are very damaged {OECT 9, 33; 44 (but with hitpu); 51; 57; 68; VS 15, 37 (but with hitpu)). Not

damaged is OECT 9, 54 // 55, but this text is actually a quitclaim. OECT 9, 50, obv. 5-7, mentions the

garments kitu, suppatu and l}usandtu, besides Ut^potu sa ana lubustu; which is a clear indication that the

former .were not mentioned in place of the latter in texts where lubustu is missing. OECT 9, 40 may be a

kutimmutu-prehend {sd KI '6KU.DIM.MES, cf. G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS 4, 89) and also mentions the

offerings of the lubustu-certmonies (obv 2-3: hi-it-pi.MES [...] [sd (^^'blu\-bu-sd-a-tu gab-bi sd An-tU4

199 SeeII.3.1.

II. 3. Monthly ceremonies

sources for these prebends; the goldsmith (kutimmu) was responsible for the ornaments

and garments ofthe statues ofthe gods, stored in the bitpiristi.

In these texts, lubustu is mentioned in connection with the Az(pM-offerings, using

the phrase ‘the hitpu-offQxings of{sa) the clothing ceremonies’; sa apparently has to be

interpreted as ‘belonging to’, i.e. ‘offerings presented during the clothing ceremonies’.

The reference to the ox in the New Year ritual text TU 39, obv. 12200 may refer, as

McEwan has pointed out,20) to the ^/(pw-offerings, because here these offerings are

also mentioned in connection with lubustu. However, in the prebend texts the hitpu- offerings always consist ofsheep. In OECT 9, 60,202 obv. 7 it is specifically stated that

the hitpu-oIfQnngs are performed on the lubustu-deiys’.

^z/pw-offerings, which on the day(s) ofthe clothing ceremonies ^are offered to Anu, Antu

and the great gods, are brought up(?) (to the table monthly)... ’.

Fosseyhas studied several texts belonging to a small archive ofthe Eanna-temple in Uruk,

mostly dating from the reigns of Cyrus and Cambyses (539-522), in which offerings

ofsheep and goats in the temple for each day of one particular month are described.203

Among these AzYpzz-offerings are often mentioned. As Beaulieu has shown,204 they

involved the offering of a kid at average intervals of seven days, four times a month,

usually on days 6/7, 13/14, 20/21 and 27/28 of each month. However, other days for

these Az7/7zz-offerings are also attested and apparently the inconsistency of the system

was caused by the fact that the AzY/»zz-offerings were tied to the four lunar phases. These

phases varied from 6.75 to 7.75 days and this could explain the variety in the intervals

between the ceremonies. Thus the ^zYpzz-offerings, and also other cultic events like the

clothing ceremony, could take place a day earlier or later than the average seven days

interval date, and since hitpu and lubustu appear to be connected in the Hellenistic

prebend texts, they might have taken place on the same day.

Although the only certain monthly date for lubustu from Hellenistic Uruk is 20-I/XII

{TU 48), it does fit the schedule ofthe Az/pzz-days, and therefore it is not unlikely that

the clothing ceremony in Hellenistic Uruk was performed on days 6/7, 13/14, 20/21

and 27/28 of each month. Similar to the essesu-CQVQmony, the fact that the days are not

mentioned in the texts probably means that these were well-known and that it was not

bajjdtu is a nocturnal ceremony, a vigil held during the night in the temple.205 The

ceremony is not mentioned in the Assyrian rituals,206 but it is attested from the Neo- Babylonian period onwards, mainly in administrative documents from Uruk and Baby- lon.207

II. 3. Monthly ceremonies

tu^^^ essesu^^^ saldm biti^^^ and nabriP-^^ (not attested in texts from the Hellenistic

period), and with the offerings niqe sarri, niqe kdribi, ginu, and guqqu,'^^^ which

clearly demonstrates the monthly character ofthe ceremony. The foodstuffs which were

presented for the ceremony consisted of bread and butter,2i4 Dilmtm dates,2i5 Dilmun

dates(?) and raisins,216 sesame,2i7 barley,2i8 and meat.2i9

The Hellenistic period

In texts from the Hellenistic period we have a few examples ofbajjdtu.^^^ The ceremony

is attested in an administrative document, CT 49,150, from Babylon. The text contains

a list oftemple expenditures; the relevant passage22i mentions 4 shekels for the bgjjdtu- ceremony of day 16 ofmonth IX, and day 3 ofmonth XI.222

We only have a few examples from Uruk, and only in ritual texts, but they are

important because they provide us with insightinto the way the ceremony was performed.

Firstly bajjdtu is recorded in TU 38, in the above mentioned list recording several

offerings and ceremomes;223 fj-om this passage it becomes clear that loaves and cakes

and oxen and sheep were apparently used during the ceremony. Secondly, in TU 39 we

have a description of the vigil held during the night of days 9 and 10 of the seventh

month Tasntu, during the second New Year festival in Uruk: the relevant passage224

describes that in the evening ofday 9 the second meal ofthe morning is cleared, and the

first main meal ofthe evening is served. After a censer is filled, offerings presented, and

a recitation is performed by the singers, this meal is cleared and the second meal ofthe

evening is served. The singers perform the same recitation again, the second meal is not

yet cleared, the vigil goes on the entire night, and the gate is closed:

*

‘9... (the meal) will not be cleared. The vigil will continue the entire night{ba-a-a-at i-ba-at).

The gate will be closed’.

Then the description of day 10 begins: after two lamentations and the awakening ofthe

temple ceremony {dTk biti) are performed, the gate is opened and the vigil ends:

‘i^At dawn the gate will be opened and the vigil will be ended (ba-a-a-at DUH-wa)’.

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

T^ie text continues with the description of the rest of day 10. After the serving of the

two. meals ofthe morning and the evening the gate is closed and the day ends.

Ap extensive description of a night vigil is recorded in TU 41. The text describes

a special nocturnal festival held in the Res-temple of Anu during the vigil of days

16 and 17 of an unknown month, perhaps the tenth month Tebetu.225 The ceremonies

celebrated''during this night, including a procession with a torch, an extra meal, and

a saldm Z?rn-beremony, are probably ceremonies for a special occasion and were not

performed during every vigil. These ceremonies will be discussed below,^26 but the

standard proceedings ofthe vigil are the same as in TU 39: the evening meal is served

but not cleared away, the vigil continues the entire night {ba-a-a-at i-ba-at)f^'^ and the

gate is not closed. There is no mention of closing the gate at the end ofthe night,?28 but

in the morning ofday 17,40 minutes after sunrise the gate is opened again and the vigil

ends {ba-a-a-at DUH-dr).229

Thus the only data that we have of bajjdtu in the Hellenistic period are, from Uruk,

for days 9-VII {TU 39) and 16-X(?) (777 41), and from Babylon for days 16-IX and

3-XI (CT 49, 150). Because we only have one day from the Neo-Babylonian period,

day 17-IX from Uruk {UCP 9, 88, no. 23), there is obviously not enough information to

reconstruct the monthly schedule of bajjatu-ddiys, although days 9 and 16 may indicate

a schedule ofseven days intervals, similar to the above discussed ^z7;?M-offerings.230

II.3.5. nubattu

nubattu ‘vigil, evening’, but also ‘evening ceremony, evening meal’ is well known from

the Neo-Assyrian period, especially in ritual texts and in the hemerological series inbu

bel arhim (‘Fruit (= epithet ofthe moon god Sin), lord ofthe month’).23i As van Driel

noted,232 in the ritual texts nubattu was mostly used together with sertu ‘morning’, and

shouldbe translated ‘evening meal’ and ‘morningmeal’. In the mbw-series nubattu seems

to refer to a ceremony which had to be performed on the evening before the day on which

the essesu-CQXQmoviy was celebrated; attested days are 3,7 and 16, dedicated to Marduk,

followedby the essesu-c&VQva.oviy on the days 4,8 and 17 ofthe month, dedicated to Nabu.

The Hellenisticperiod

While from the Neo-Babylonian period examples ofnubattu with the meaning ‘evening

ceremonies’ are not known, in the Hellenistic rituals only one example is (perhaps)

attested, in TU 40, obv. 10-11. The section, from which this passage is taken, describes

225 See 1.2.

226 The text is discussed more extensively in II.8.6.

II.3. Monthly ceremonies

day 9 ofthe seventh month, TasrTtu, during the second New Year festival in Uruk (see

the Appendix);

‘lOThe sheep, which since the evening (ceremonies?) {nu-bat-tuf) [was tied(?) to] the gate of

the [Grant(?)] Courtyard, I'its rites as for the eighth day ditto’.

Whether nubattu has to be translated here ‘evening ceremony/ies’, or simple ‘evening’,

‘vigil’, is difficult to determine. It is, however, elear that no conneetion can be made

with the data of the Neo-Assyrian texts, unless day 9 is an alternative day for day 8.

Beeause we have no other examples from the Hellenistic period, it is not even certain

whether TU 40, obv. 10-11 refers to a monthly ceremony, on this occasion performed

during the New Year festival, or a special celebration, taking place only during the New

Year festival.

II.3.6. saldm biti

The ceremony called saldm bitfi^^ is best translated: ‘the good-functioning (or com

pletion) of the temple’ ceremony.234 l do not know of arguments which support the

translation ‘greeting of the temple’ or ‘early morning ceremonies’,235 and my trans

lation is based on the basic meaning of the verb saldmu ‘to stay well, to be in good

condition, intact’. Furthermore, in a ritual from Hellenistic Uruk, TU 39, rev. 5 and

8-9, an Akkadian lamentation ineipit is recorded, which may support this interpretation,

although the translation is difficult;

ti-sal-lim SILIMTM.MA.AB(?)

‘the temple will stay intact, keep it safe!’(?).

The interpretation ofthe ineipit is based on the idea, thatthe temple will not be destroyed,

or that it will be restored, and must be kept safe and sound. This lamentation ineipit

appears to refer to the saldm Zjfr/-ceremony, hence my translation: ‘the good-functioning

ofthe temple’.236

The Neo-Babylonianperiod

While we have only a few references to the ceremony in texts from the Neo-Assyrian

period,237 many data are available from texts of the Neo-Babylonian period. In his

dissertation, Bongenaar has discussed the saldm 6fif/-ceremony for Samas and other

233 Cf. F. Thureau-Dangin, RA 16 (1919), 132, n. 10; G. Furlani, Riti, 147; A.B. Moldenke, 2, no. 48, 135,

n. 5; F. Joannes, Textes economiques, 212.

234 Cf. AHw, saldmu, 1144a, 6, ‘erhalten bleiben’, b, ‘in Function bleiben’; and id., epesu, 225b, h:

‘(Hausvollendung)’. See also GC 1, 27, n. 1; G.J.R McEwan, FAOS 4, 166 does not translate, but states

that the ceremony ‘seemingly was concerned with insuring the continued well-being ofthe temple’.

235 CAD, S/I, 202b. A.R. George, BTT, 222, n. 3, probably follows CAD since he states that the ceremony

‘is apparently an exuberant greeting ofthe city’s temples in anticipation ofthe feast-day ahead’.

236 See also my comments on this ineipit in the Appendix.

237 Cf G. van Driel, Cult ofAssur, 168. See also the letter S. Parpola, LAS I, 280 {ABL 437), rev. 17.

gods in Neo-Babylonian Sippar.238 it appears to be so that in Sippar thirteen saldm bTti- ceremonies for the whole year were celebrated on: 2-1, 6-1, lO-1,12-11,14-11,19/207-11,

12-m, 20-m, 8-VII, 187-VIII, 27-VIII, 20-XII and 25-XII. However, it is not certain

whether the ceremonies for Samas and the other gods took place on the same day.

We will compare these days in Sippar with the data from Neo-Babylonian Uruk and

Babylon.

IL4. Annual ceremonies

these monthly-occurring cultic activities clearly shows that saldm biti is also a monthly

ceremony. For the saldm br//-ceremonies, flour,24S meat,249 vessels,250 and pajonents^^i

are attested.

Because we only have a few data for the ceremony, it is not possible to say much

about fhe schedule of the saldm blti-days in Neo-Babylonian Uruk and Babylon. It is

interesting however, that of the five data that we have, four concern day 8, and that

only months VII and IX are attested. GC 1, 203 from Uruk records day 8, but does not

mention the month; YOS 6, 192 and 189 mention days 8-IX and 8-VII. US' 6, 268 from

Babylon mentions two saldm 6fri-ceremonies (ina 2 sa-lam E), one on day 8-VII and

one on 5-VII, but the latter may well be a mistake for day 8.

It is clear that the Sippar-schedule does not completely agree with our data: YOS 6,

192 (Uruk) and VS 6, 268 (Babylon) mention month IX, which is not attested in the

Sippar-texts, but the other days (8-VII in YOS 6,189 and VS 6,268) do agree with them.

The Hellenisticperiod

The saldm Z)f//-ceremony is attested only once in texts from the Hellenistic period;252 in

TU 41, rev. 16, the i^a«gi2-priests and the temple enterers {erib biti) perform the ceremony

in the Res-temple of Anu in Uruk during the vigil preceding day 17 of (perhaps) the

tenth month 'Tebetu^^B (see the Appendix):

‘14 ... The iawgM-priests ofthe temples of Tiranna (and) secondly the temple enterers {erib

biti) ofall the temples i^will kindle a fire from the torch and they will carry (it) to theirtemple.

Then i^they will perform the the good-functioning ofthe temple ceremony {sa-lam E). They

will kindle a brushwood pile at the gates oftheir temple’.

Day 17-X is not attested in texts from Neo-Babylonian Uruk and Babylon.

II.4. Annual ceremonies

The Babylonian year consisted of twelve months. However, because a lunar year of

twelve months consists of 354 days, the lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar

year with 365.25 days. For this reason after c. 600 B.C. a series of second Ululus

and second Addarus had to be added, that is seven months in every cycle of nineteen

years.254 Based on the agricultural cycle, the year started around the time ofthe spring

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

equinox.255 While the first month of the civil year is Nisannu, beginning around the

middle of March,256 and ending around the middle of April, the religious year began

in the seventh month TasrTtu (September/October);257 as we will see, for this reason

two New Year festivals were celebrated, one in Nisannu and one in TasrTtu.258 The year

ended with the month Addaru, around February/March.

During the Babylonian cultic year ceremonies were celebrated, which occurred only

on a fixed (number of) day(s) ofa particular month. The most important and well-known

aimual ceremonies were celebrated during the New Year festival. However, there were

more, ofwhich we often know only very little.

In this section the unspecified ceremonies, recorded in legal documents from Hellenistic

Uruk concerned with prebend shares, will be discussed first, followed by the clothing

ceremonies, the processions, and the divine marriage ceremonies. Then we will turn our

attention to the New Year festivals ofUruk and Babylon, as known from texts from the

Hellenistic period. Also, the brazier festivals will be discussed. Finally, all the collected

data are brought together in two cultic calendars, one for Uruk, and one for Babylon.

II.4.1. Unspecified annual ceremonies'^^^

Uruk

While the monthly ceremonies are usually not dated, the annual ceremonies often

were given an exact date by referring to the day and month on which they were

performed; often the text specifically adds: sattussu ‘every year, yearly’. In Hellenistic

legal documents concerning prebend shares from Uruk a ceremony is recorded for

Papsukkal on day 17 of TasrTtu,260 a ceremony for Antu on day 8 of Addaru, and a

ceremony for Belet-seri on day 10 ofAddaru.

255 The res satti (SAG MU.AN.NA) ‘beginning ofthe year’ was either the period between approximately

15-XII and 15-1 (cf. E.F. Weidner, Handbuch, 82 f.), or, more likely, the ‘New Year’s day’ (cf. S. Parpola, LAS

II, 15 and 54).

256 In the Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods day l-I fell approximately 14 days after the equinox (with

variations of course), cf. H. Hunger, WZKM 67 (1975), 27.

257 res satti could also refer to the seventh month, cf. E.F. Weidner, Handbuch, 83 and S. Parpola, LAS II,

187. In ancient Israel a New Year in the first month Nisan and in the seventh month Tisri were also known,

cf. A.J. Wensinck, Acta Or. 1 (1923), 168. A. Cavigneaux and F. AI-Rawi, Iraq 55 (1993), 96 f. noted an

interesting parallel between Babylonia and Israel: in Babylonia the writing ofthe tablets offates forthe whole

coming year on day 7-VII is paralleled in Israel by the sealing ofthe destinies at the same time ofthe year,

on Yom Kippur. A Syrian text identifies Nisan as the ‘beginning ofthe months’ and Tisri as the ‘beginning

ofthe year’, cf S.P. Brock, JSS 30 (1985), 186. Also the Romans originally had two moments when the year

began: the Idus ofMarch and the Saturnalia in December, cf H.S. Versnel, Triumphus. An inquiry into the

origin, development and meaning ofthe Roman triumph, Leiden, 1970, 228. Note that the Akkadian name

for the seventh month, Tasntu, means ‘beginning’, cf W.G. Lambert, NABU 1989, no. 90.

annual ceremonies, while it is not attested for the unspecified monthly ceremonies.265

Several more ceremonies are known, the nature ofwhich is often not clear. Because

the data are all from calendar texts, we must assume that all ceremonies collected here

were celebrated yearly. Only a few are known from Uruk: five ceremonies on day 10 [+

x], 22, 26, 27 and 29 of the eleventh month Sabatu are attested in the calendar text K

3753,266 but because ofthe damaged state ofthe passage the context is difficult.

Babylon

Most ofthe ceremonies come from Babylon, and all are,^ttested in the calendar texts SBH

VII // BRM 4, 25 and SBH VIII. However the relevant passages are often damaged, and

the context ofthe attested ceremonies is in many cases difficult. Ofthe many references

to ceremonies, often together with offerings, we will list here those which can form part

ofthe cultic calendar.267 We will enumerate the ceremonies in a chronological order.

A ceremony with Nabu in the (temple) garden on day 6 ofthe second month Ajjaru268

is known, followed by a ceremony of Nabu on day 7 of Ajjaru in the garden of Anu,

situated in Emeurur, which is probably the temple ofNanaja at Babylon.269

II. Ceremonies, rituals andfestivals

Belet-ilT celebrated a ceremony on day 15 of the third month Simanu,270 and a

ceremony ofNabu and an unknown god was held on day 22 of Simanu

On day 18 of the eighth month Araljsamna a ceremony with offerings for Samas

and others in various temples, including a procession and a ceremony with a brazier

(kinunu) is recorded,272 and on day 25-VIII, a ceremony with offerings for Zababa of

Kis and furthermore for the city Isin and the temple Esabad, including a ceremony with

the abgalgungunnu-dmm and the kettledrum (lilissu).^'^^

We also know ofseveral ceremonies ofthe ninth month KislTmu, which all include

offerings for a certain deity: for Marduk, Zarpamtu and others on day 4-IX,274 which is

confirmed by a reference to a ceremony before Marduk on the same day elsewhere;275

for Enlils (dEN.LIL.MES) and Adads (^IM.MES), and others on day 6/7-IX;276 for

Lugalbanda on day 8-IX;277 for Lugalasal (Bel-sarbati), including a ceremony with

braziers on day 9-IX;278 for Ea and others, including a ceremony with the hall}allatu- drum on day 10-IX;279 for Istar of Babylon on day 12-IX;280 for AnunTtu and Sarrat- Sippar ofBabylon on day 13-IX;28i for Asratu on day 14-IX;282 for Anassat(?)283 and

Belet-Agade on day 15-IX;284 for Nabu and others, including a ceremony with braziers,

on day 16/17-IX,285 which is confirmed by another reference to a ceremony for Nabu

on day 17 elsewhere;286 for Uras, including a ceremony with a brazier on day 22-IX;2S7

for Lugalmar(a)da and others on day 25-IX;288 and for Nergal on day 28/9-IX.289

Finally, for day 10 of the tenth month Tebetu a ceremony with offerings for Palil,

including a ceremony with braziers, is attested.290

II.4.2. Annual clothing ceremonies

While the data from the Neo-Babylonian and Hellenistic periods usually refer to the

regularly celebrated monthly clothing ceremonies,292 there is some evidence from Hel

lenistic Uruk and Babylon that lubustu was also celebrated yearly on special occasions,

as for example during the New Year festival,293 although due to lack ofinformation the

‘annual’ character ofthe ceremony is not always certain.

Uruk

We know of several clothing ceremonies from Uruk, which may have been celebrated

only occasionally.

291 And neighbouring towns/cities, see A.R. George, BTT, 222, n. 4.

292 For the monthly celebrated lubustu-cexexaony see II.3.3.

293 Cf G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS 4, 164.

65

The ritual text TU 39, describing the New Year festival ofthe seventh month TasrTtu,

refers to several gods being robed (nalbusu) on days 1 and 6 (obv. 1 and 6), and then

records in a summarised version the clothing ceremonies (lubustu) of Anu, Antu and

Istar on the seventh day ofthe festival; the passage also mentions clothing ceremonies

which are performed before the guqqu-oflQnngs (obv. 11-13):

As to the cellar the clothing ceremonies (^&lu-bu-sd-at) ofAnu and Antu and the clothing

ceremonies ofIstar. i2The setting in place ofthe ox. (Inside the room) between the curtains:

songs by the singer and the lamentation priest. i3(The presentation of) gw^^i2-offerings

which follow the clothing ceremonies (f^^lu-bu-us-tul) and (the presentation of) the siltu- food (offerings). The consecration ofthe temple’.

A clothing ceremony of Anu and Adad on day 3 ofthe sixth month Ululu is recorded

in the calendar text K 3753.^94 Furthermore CLBT, pi. 1 contains, in obscure context, a

reference to a clothing ceremony.295 w 18728296 does not contain clothing ceremonies

but gives instructions for the clothing of various cultic functionaries, including several

priests,297 and the king.298 The text probably deals with clothing instructions for a special

festival, because ofa reference to ‘the second day’ (ina 2-i u^-m{u .. .]),299 so apparently

refers to a festival lasting several days.^oo No data are mentioned.

Babylon

From Babylon four clothing ceremonies are attested in the calendar text SBH VIII: a

clothing ceremony ofMarduk presumably on day 8 ofthe first month Nisannu, during the

New Year festival,30i a clothing ceremony ofNabu for the divine marriage ceremony on

the second day ofthe second month Ajjaru,302 a clothing ceremony perhaps ofMarduk

on day 3 ofthe ninth month KislTmu,^®^ and a clothing ceremony ofan unlmown god on

day 16 of KislTmu.304

200 Cf. A. Falkenstein, UVB 15 (1959), 40. Perhaps we should connect these clothing instructions with the

New Year festival, see rev. 8': lu-bu-us-tu^ LUGAL sd ina sa-bat SU« D1NG1R.ME§ il-lab-bis ‘clothing of

the king, which he will wear when he takes the gods by thie hands’; the phrase qate sabdtu is well-known,

especially in texts describing the New Year festival. For this phrase see my comments on TU 39, obv 27 in

the Appendix. On the other hand, the passage describing the clothing instructions for the lamentation priest

with references to lubdru-cloihmg and the kettledrum (obv lO'fif.) reminds us ofthe third version ofthe lunar

eclipse ritual, dealing with the duties ofthe lamentation priest during this ritual, where the lubdru-clothmg

and the kettledrum are also mentioned. See 11.7.3.

II.4.3. Processions

The processions in Assyria and Babylonia of the first millennium have been discussed

by B. Pongratz-Leisten.310 Here we will list those which are recorded in texts from

Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon.

Uruk

From Uruk the procession ofAnu for the first New Year festival ofthe month Nisannu

is described in KAR 132, but on which day(s) this occurred is not certain - probably

day 8. The procession of Anu, performed during the second New Year festival of the

month TasrTtu, is attested in BRM 4, 7 and TU 39-40, and took place on day 8 and

day 9.^^^ Furthermore we have a procession during a festival for Istar, TU 42 +, but no

reference is made to the day(s) on which it occurred.^^2 Also a procession ofAnu took

clothed] with fine attire ofthe Lordship [...]’. 205 For the dumuniglala, an unknown priest, see G. C^girgan, W.G. Lambert, JCS 43-45 (1991-1993), 90b.

place during a nocturnal feast in the Res-temple, 71/ 41, on day 16 and 17, probably of

the month Tebetu.^^^

More processions from Hellenistic Uruk are known. A procession of MTsaru, from

Ehenunna, the temple of Adad, on day 5 of Arahsamna is attested in the ritual text TU

39;3i4 this procession is also attested for the same day in the calendar text K 3753.315 in

the latter a procession ofNusku and Ningal into the streets ofUruk, and a procession of

Nusku through the squares (rebftu) ofUruk, during day 3(?) ofthe month Ululu is also

recorded.316 Lastly a procession of a god(?) from the presence ofAnu to Samas, on day

18 ofArahsamna is mentioned.317

Babylon^^^

The New Year procession to the aAT/M-temple during the month Nisannu in Babylon on

day 8 is well-known from pre-Hellenistic texts, but from Hellenistic Babylon we only

have two references, one in an astronomical diary,319 and one in a calendar text.32o

Otherprocessions are also known. Three more processions are attested in the calendar

text SBH VIII from Babylon: a marriage procession ofNabu and Ninkali (?= Nanaja?)

from Ezida to Eursaba (the cella of Nanaja in Esagila),32i on day 2 of Ajjaru,322 a

procession of Nabu to Emeurur, on day 7 of Ajjaru,323 and a procession of Nanaja

from Eursaba to the ‘garden of the Mountain’, on day 17 of Ajjaru.324 A procession

ofthe assinnu-pviest to the House of Lament (bit sipitte) for day 15 of Simanu, and a

procession ofthe AMrgarnJ-priest to a cultic place called the Equlu is attested for day 16

the statue ofAnu and his chariot (narkabtu)C?).

Diaries, no. -168, A, obv. 14-15), is discussed in II.8.4.

II.4. Annual ceremonies

of Simanu, followed by a procession to the Uras-gate.325 A procession of ‘the sons of

BeT to Enamhe, the temple of Adad in Babylon, is recorded for day 18 of Arahsamna

in a calendar text.326

More processions from Babylon during the month BCislTmu are attested in BM

32206 +.327 The text first records several events concerning Bel and several other

cult-participants, including a slave, a bull, and Ea’s vizier Usmu, on day 3 of KislTmu

in Esagila,328 leading up to the journey ofthe latter three on day 4 of KislTmu from the

entrance of the cella (bdb papdl}iy^^ to the aAfiM-temple,330 after which the return to

Esagila on the same day is described.33i Furthermore, the text records three days, day

8 of TasrTtu, day 4 ofIGslImu, and a third lost day, on which a procession of Ninurta

and the statue ofBel (or Enlil?) departs from their cellas and sits at a gate, the name of

which is lost.332 xhe text describes another procession(?) ‘from the opposite bank’ (ultu

ahuld) on day 16 of an unknown month, but the context is not clear.333

Finally, in an administrative document from the Arsacid period, BRM 1,99,334 silver

is paid for several groups ofpersons involved in a procession on day 1 of an unknown

month: for the kurgarru-actovs, assinnu-singQT and songstresses, for the brewers(?), for

two unknown groups ofpeople, for the millers and for the Borsippaeans. The procession

possibly took place during the so-called ‘Love Lyrics Ritual’ ofIstar ofBabylon in her

temple Eturkalamma.335 ^
