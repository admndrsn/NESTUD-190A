V. APPENDICES

' APPENDIX No. 1

Meeting No. 1

STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING

PRICES AND CONSUMPTION

The purpose of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement is

to make possible the orderly marketing of coffee under the

extraordinary conditions which have resulted from the pres- ent world conflict. These conditions aggravated an already

serious surplus problem in coffee-producing countries and

brought about a decline in coffee prices to extremely low

levels. The Board does not believe that the continuation of

distress prices which threaten the economic stability and

purchasing power of producers is in the interest of coffee con- sumers or is desired by them.

The Board wishes to make clear, however, that it will be

its purpose, in the administration of the Agreement, to main- tain coffee prices at reasonable levels which will encourage

consumption. For the United States, which constitutes the

largest single market for coffee, there has been a significant

increase in consumption in recent years. The Board believes

that, with the maintenance of reasonable prices, consumption

in the United States may be further increased and that the

surplus problem in producing countries may be thereby

substantially alleviated. Consumers in the United States may

accordingly be assured that their interests will be safeguarded

under this program of inter-American cooperation.

[58]

MEMORANDUM REGARDING CONVERSION

FACTORS

The oflScial statistics of the United States Department of

Commerce relative to coffee imports are in pounds. The

Government of the United States will convert bags of 60

kilograms, the unit of measure specified in the Agreement, to

pounds for quota purposes at the rate of one bag equals

132.276 pounds.

Under the Agreement imports of roasted coffee are in- cluded within the import quotas established by the United

States. Therefore it is necessary that a basis be established

for charging such imports to the quotas. The Government

of the United States proposes, if the Board concurs, to use

the factor of 1.2 in converting imports of roasted coffee to

the green coffee equivalent for quota purposes. Thus quan- tities of imports of roasted coffee will be multiplied by the

factor 1.2. This assumes an average shrinkage in the roasting

process of approximately 16 percent.

WHEREAS:

1. It is advisable to maintain up-to-date information on

coffee sales registered in the producing countries, within the

export quota; and

2. Having this information in due time wotdd avoid all

difficulties and would make it possible for the Board to follow

the course of the sales of coffee in each country and to

know at all times the unfilled balance on their respective

quotas; •

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

1. To request all the signatory Governments of the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement to communicate the

amount of all coffee sales registered since the 1st of October

last, in bags of 60 kgs.;

2. To request that henceforth they communicate through

the most rapid medium, on Monday of each week, the amount

of the sales registered up to and including Saturday of the

previous week.

Excellency:

I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the

Inter-American Coffee Board, at its meeting of April 23,

1941, in accordance with the provisions of Article X, para- graph (d) of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, ap- proved its budget of expenses for the period between April

15, 1941, the date on which the Board was created, and Sep- tember 30, 1941, the end of the current quota year, in the

amount of $18,000. Installation expenses are included in

this figure.

There is attached a table showing the amounts corres- ponding to the respective governments participating in the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement, in accordance with the

provisions of Article XIII of the aforesaid Agreement.

It is suggested that the most convenient manner for ef- fecting payment would be for each government to forward

the corresponding amount to the Board through its delegate

to the Board, who will be given a receipt signed by the Chair- man and Secretary of the Board. Checks or drafts may be

made payable to the Inter-American Coffee Board.

STATEMENT REGARDING ARRIVALS OF COFFEE

IN EXCESS OF QUOTAS

The Inter-American Coffee Board has given earnest con- sideration to representations made by certain shippers and im- porters concerning hardships arising from arrivals of coffees

to the United States in excess of the quota established for

such coffees. While regretting any hardships that may have

been caused, the Board finds itself without authority to have

those coffees entered for consumption in the United States.

The treaty provisions involved are most specific and make

no allowance for exceptions of the type that would be re- quired in this case. The Board feels that with improved ex- port regulations and the cooperation of shippers, few situa- tions of this kind need arise in the future.

APPENDIX No. 5

Meeting No. 4

May 15, 1941

[63]

STATEMENT REGARDING DIVERTED SHIPMENTS

The Inter-American Coffee Board has taken cognizance

of the fact that efforts have been made to evade the inten- tions of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement through false

representations to authorities in producing countries that

particular lots of coffee were intended for sale in countries

other than the United States, whereas the actual intention

was to enter the coffee for consumption in the United States.

TheBoard condenms this practice and intends to take effec- tive steps to terminate it, in cooperation with the Govern- ments of the countries participating in the Inter-American

Coffee Agreement.

1. To authorize the participating producing countries,

once they have exported the total amount of their respective

quotas for the current quota year, to export to the United

States before next September 30, to be charged to their re

spective quotas for the next quota year, an amount of coffee

not to exceed 15 per cent of their respective basic quotas, on

condition that the coffee so exported be warehoused under the

supervision of the United States customs authorities so that

it is not entered for consumption before October 1, 1941.

TELEGRAM FROM NATIONAL COFFEE ASSOCIA- TION PROTESTING AGAINST CERTAIN DEVEL- OPMENTS IN THE OPERATION OF THE

INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE

AGREEMENT

New York, N. Y.,

July 9, 1941.

Paul C. Daniels, Chairman,

Inter-American Coffee Board,

2400 16 Street, Northwest,

Washington, D. C.

On behalf of the United States coffee trade I respect- fully call to your attention the following facts namely that

five of the governments, parties to the Inter-American Cof- fee Treaty, have failed in their obligations under the treaty

in the following respects. Venezuela in that it permitted

an agency wholly financed by the government to consign

large quantities of coffee in the United States and that it

permitted coffee to be exported greatly in excess of its quota

in direct violation of Articles Four and Seventeen of the

agreement. Guatemala in that it permitted coffee to be ex- ported in amoxmts so greatly in excess of its quota as to indi- cate a lack of serious effort to control exports as it is required

to do under Article Four of the Agreement. Haiti in that it

instituted regulations which make it impossible for American

importers to secure coffee they have already purchased with- out paying an additional sum to Haitian exporters. This is

violation of Article Seventeen of the agreement. Brazil as

is clearly indicated has permitted amounts of coffee to be

registered greatly in excess of its quota and has on some oc- APPENDIX No. 12

Meeting No. 8

July 9, 1941

[73]

casions refused export permits of coflFee properly registered

and has permitted its quota to be filled without regard for

coffees sold registered and intended for shipment in August

and September all this in violation of Articles Six and Seven- teen of the treaty. Colombia in that it permitted coffee to

be shipped in excess of its quota in violation of Article Four

of the treaty in that it failed to take measures required in

Article Six of the treaty. In that it did, we have reason to

believe, permit a government dependency to consign coffee

to the United States in violation of Article Seventeen and

finally in that it made possible a severe shortage of Colom- bian coffees on the west coast of the United States. All these

acts of commission and omission havec caused serious disrup- tion to the trade in the United States and have caused indivi- dual importers serious and unjustified losses. In view of the

obvious equities in the matter we believe ourselves entitled

to request expression from the Board as to whether the Board

has or can secure authority to arbitrate the losses sustained

and proved by United States importers on account of the

failure mentioned above and if it can secure from the gov- ernment in question authority to make adequate compensa- tion for these losses. We would like to be informed also as

to what guarantee the Board can secure for itself and for the

trade of the United States that the above mentioned failures

of compliance will not re-occur. The coffee trade has and

does support the quota system as written into the treaty be- lieving it a necessary and desirable action but feels that the

system cannot function under circumstances which make

contracts meaningless or unless the Board assumes the full

authority of administration assigned it under the provisions

of the treaty. Respectfully,

LETTERTO THE NATIONAL COFFEE ASSOCIATION

REPLYING TO THE ASSOCIATION’S

COMPLAINTS

July 18,1941.

Mr. George C. Thierbach, ^

President, National Coffee Association,

120 Wall Street,

New York, New York.

My dear Mr. Thierbach;

I acknowledge the receipt of your telegram dated July

9, 1941 in which you call to the attention of the Inter- American Coffee Board, on behalf of the United States coffee

trade, certain alleged irregularities in the operation and ad- ministration of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Sup- plementing the Board’s preliminary acknowledgment of July

9, a more detailed reply is now submitted regarding the

various points raised in your telegram under reference.

You call attention to the fact that in the case of certain

countries exports of coffee have taken place in excess of the

corresponding quotas for those countries. It is unques- tionably true that in the cases you mention coffee exports

have in fact exceeded the quotas established for those coun- tries. It is equally true that in the case of one country en- tries of coffee into the United States for consumption dur- ing the current quota year exceeded the corresponding coffee

quota for that country. The Inter-American Coffee Board

naturally regrets that these discrepancies have occured dur-

[75]

ing the present quota year, but feels impelled to call atten- tion to the following facts. In the first place, the Inter- American Coffee Agreement was not signed until nearly two

months of the initial quota period had elapsed. Following

signature, the Agreement had no legal effect until such time

as the instruments of ratification of the 15 participating

countries had been deposited in the Pan American Union, or

until such time as it had been brought into effect by means

of a protocol for the purpose as provided in Article XX. It

was not until April 15, 1941, or after more than one-half

of the current quota year had elapsed, that the Inter- American Coffee Agreement became legally effective. Up

until that date there was a lack of complete assurance in

each of the 15 coimtries that the Agreement would in fact

become effective, and it was correspondingly difficult for

each of the 15 countries to perfect its laws, regulations and

administrative procedure in such a way as to harmonize with

the new and unprecedented coffee program established under

the terms of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Not- withstanding this difficulty, efforts were made in each of the

countries to anticipate the situation and to prepare for ade- quate means for discharging their obligations under the treaty.

While the initial steps taken did not prove to be adequate in

all cases, the experience received during the last few months

has been valuable and the Board is confident that each

participating country is giving serious attention to the mat- ter in an effort to perfect its regulations and avoid a recur- rence of the difficulties brought about by exports in excess

of the established quotas. The Board has received no evidence

of any intention on the part of any participating government

deliberately to violate the terms of the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement; rather, there is no doubt that the government

of each producing country intends to take all appropriate

[76]

measures with a view to preventing in the future exports

of coffee in excess of the duly established quotas.

A somewhat similar problem has arisen by virtue of the

fact that in at least one case there is evidence to indicate that

registrations of sales of coffee for future delivery have been

permitted in excess of the corresponding quota. The same

general considerations set forth above in the preceding

pa**agraph apply likewise to this matter. There is ample

evidence to indicate that neither the country in question,

nor any other country, intends to permit a recurrence of this

difficidty during the coming quota year or at any time in

the future. Furthermore, the Inter-American Coffee Board

is undertaking the compilation of registration figures from

each of the producing countries, has approved a standard

form for submitting this information on a weekly basis, and

believes that its efforts in this direction, together with im- proved regulations in the exporting countries, will make a

repetition of the problem extremely unlikely.

Protest is made in your telegram under reference against

the consignment of coffee in the United States by govern- mental agencies or dependencies. Although the Board has

not received very detailed information or evidence on this

point, it has agreed as a matter of policy that governmental

consignments of this character should be discouraged or

prohibited by each of the participating governments in order

to maintain, in so far as possible, the normal and usual op- eration of the coffee trade. It should be pointed out, how- ever, that governmental consignments of this character may

well have occurred prior to the entry into force of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, and accordingly constitute a

problem for the trade which might exist in the absence of a

quota agreement.

[77]

There are enclosed statements submitted by the dele- gates of Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala discussing their

individual problems in more detail.

Reference is made in your telegram to the effect that

regulations have been instituted in one of the participating

countries *Vhich make it impossible for American importers

to secure coffee they have already purchased without paying

an additional sum to . . . exporters”. The Inter-American

Coffee Board states categorically that it is definitely opposed

to any regulations in any of the countries participating in the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement which might have the

effect of nullifying contracts entered into in good faith. The

Board believes that the sanctity of contracts in commercial

dealings must be upheld at all costs; that the contract system

provides a useful method for handling the coffee business,

with benefits for producers, distributors and consumers

alike. Accordingly, the Board desires to be informed of any

case where a contract entered into in good faith is nullified

retroactively by official act. In the case cited in your tele- gram under reference, it is understood that the regulations

in question do not prevent compliance with previously

existing contracts.

The present situation on the West Coast of the United

States due to the inability of importers to obtain delivery

on certain coffees which have been previously purchased,

entry of which is prohibited by the closing of the quotas,

is currently being considered by the Board in an effort to

determine what action, if any, should be taken by the Board.

It is naturally desired that all reasonable and appropriate

steps be taken to avoid undue hardship on the part of any

single individual or firm in the coffee trade of the United

[78]

States; at the same time, the Board cannot help but feel a

responsibility for the maintenance of the Inter-American

Coffee Agreement on a stable basis, and its operation in an

impartial, non-discriminatory manner for the protection

of the coffee trade as a whole.

You inquire *'as to whether the Board has or can secure

authority to arbitrate the losses sustained^ and proved by

United States importers”. Without entering into a discus- sion of whether the Board has or has not authority to act as

arbitrator for losses sustained in such cases, it may be stated

that in the opinion of the Board it would be of doubtful

value for it to undertake the arbitration of disputes arising

from losses. In certain cases resort to arbitration by a quali- fied arbitrator or group of arbitrators may provide the most

expedient manner for settling current problems; but it is not

believed that the Inter-American Coffee Board would provide

a suitable means for this procedure at the present time. The

Board hopes, however, that it will be found possible for the

parties at interest to work out a mutually satisfactory and

equitable settlement.

The Inter-American Coffee Board has noted with pleas- ure your statement that the coffee trade has supported and

does support the quota system as written into the treaty. It

agrees that the system cannot function under circumstances

which make contracts meaningless. It is confident, as set

forth above, that the problems which you have specified are

essentially problems of transition, due primarily to the in- auguration of a vast and unprecedented control system re- quiring complete cooperation by 15 countries and presenting

a new set of circumstances for the operation of the coffee

trade. There is every reason to believe that the period of

readjustment to new conditions has largely been passed, and

[79]

that there will be no recurrence of any of the problems listed

in your telegram of July 9.

The Inter-American Coffee Board is attempting to dis- charge its obligations in a thorough and impartial manner.

It has already taken many constructive steps which have been

duly made known to the trade and the public. Its work is

only beginning. It welcomes constructive suggestions from

all sources. Accordingly, if the National Coffee Association,

or any other organization or individual in the United States

having an interest in the coffee situation, has any specific sug- gestions as to any acts of commission or omission by the Inter- American Coffee Board, I can assure you that they will be

given very careful attention by the Board. A cooperative

attitude and a mutual understanding of each other’s problems

and difficulties will go far towards eliminating the rough

spots.

Sincerely yours,

Paul C. Daniels, Chairman.

NATIONAL COFFEE DEPARTMENT OF BRAZIL

120 Wall Street

New York, N.Y.

The charges filed by the National Coffee Association

against the National Coffee Department of Brazil are with- out foundation due to the following reasons:

180]

1. The excess (of less than 5% of our quota) in the

registration of sales for the first year of the agreement

was caused by our inability to obtain proper informa- tion at this end, such as classification of arrivals by ships

and dates of entry into territories under American

jurisdiction. Therefore, not knowing the details per- taining to coffee shipments fulfilling the Brazilian quota

under the agreement, we were unable to determine (as

we still are, notwithstanding our request to the Inter- American Coffee Board) exactly when to stop registra- tion of coffee for this year’s quota. Such data was in- dispensable for rigid control of the first year’s quota,

due to the fact that the agreement signed in November

included coffee already shipped from Brazil in Septem- ber, over which naturally we could not have had con- trol as is required under the terms of the Agreement;

2. It is very likely that such circumstances and similar

conditions were foreseen when the Agreement was

signed, since Article IV admitted the possibility of an

excess shipment and provided for such an excess to be

deducted from the next year’s quota;

3. Furthermore, until the Agreement had been effectively

ratified by all the signatory countries it would be under- standable that we could not undertake all the neces- sary precuationary measures against such an excess, since

it would have been against the interests of Brazil, in the

event that the Agreement were not put into effect.

However, disregarding such possibilities, we closed the

registration of sales for the first year under the quota

on March 21, 1941, as stated in the communication of

the National Coffee Department of Brazil, released on

[81]

/

March 22,1941, which was quite some time prior to the

installation of the Inter-American Coffee Board, and be- fore the United States Government was legally able to

take the necessary steps for the control of coffee ship- ments entering this country under the provisions of the

Agreement;

4. We should add that the “shipment certificate” which is

referred to in Article VI of the Agreement, and which

is indispensable for the identification of coffee ship- ments from each country, is, up to the present date,

being enforced by Brazil only, and has not yet been

considered by the United States Customs;

5. There are no grounds for the statement that we have

refused permits for shipments of coffee properly regis- tered, and these facts may easily be verified by anyone

who is famiiliar with the coffee and exchange regula- tions of Brazil;

6. In truth, what we have not allowed is the advance ship- ments of coffee which were registered for August and

September. This, however, is a matter pertaining to our

domestic economy and has no bearing on the terms of

the Agreement. Therefore, contrary to the charges

brought against us, we feel that we have given ample

proof of our desire to fulfill all the terms of the Agree- ment, ^ shown for instance by the fact that although

disposing of a quota of 9,765,000 bags we have allocated

to the exporters only 9,300,000 bags, thus compensating

for the small excess in the first year.

(TRANSLATION)

MEMORANDUM PRESENTED BY THE DELEGATE

OF COLOMBIA

In the telegram addressed by the President of the Na- tional Coffee Association to the Chairman of the Inter- American Coffee Board it is stated, among other allegations

made to the countries signatory to the Inter-American Cof- fee Agreement, that Colombia has failed in fulfilling the

obhgations imposed on it by the said treaty in respect of the

following points:

1. For having permitted the shipment of coffee in excess

of her quota, which constitutes a violation of Article IV of

the Treaty. This afBrmation has been made by the National

Coffee Association without possessing official proofs of any

kind to support it, since the fact that arrivals of Colombian

coffee in the United States during the quota year have ex- ceeded the quota fixed for Colombia, does not imply that that

country permitted the registration of exports in excess of

her quota; on the contrary, the information possessed by the

Colombian Delegate indicates that the respective official en- tities there took the greatest care and that there was exer- cised a strict supervision of registrations, which were suspend- ed when the quota was filled. What appears to have occurred

is that subsequent to last October 1, there entered the United

States shipments of Colombian coffee which had left Colom- bia prior to that date, as seems to be the case with reference

to coffee from the region of Cucuta which was shipped from

Venezuela and which, it is understood, is held by the owners

to be aged in that country for some time past; furthermore,

as the statistics clearly show, it is understood that a good

[83]

part of the shipments registered in Colombia and destined

for Canada were held in this country by local importers,

members of the coffee trade of the United States. How can

Colombia be held responsible for these occurrences, which

were entirely beyond her control, and how, on the basis of

importations which had this origin, can the totally unfounded

allegation be made that Columbia has violated Article IV? In

fact. Article IV treats of "unforeseen circumstances” and

contemplates the case that the export quota of a given coun- try for the United States may be exceeded during the quota

year, and it is necessary to consider as cases of this character

those which have just been noted.

2. It is alleged that Colombia failed in its obligation to

take the measures required by Article VI of the Treaty. That

allegation is really surprising, to say the least, since everybody

knows that Colombia was the first country which hastened on

November 22, even before signing the Treaty, to take internal

measures of various kinds tending to establish an adequate

control of the sales and exportation of coffee, precisely with

the purpose of avoiding difficulties which might arise in the

operation of the Pact. The certificate referred to in Article

VI is only now being discussed by the Inter-American Coffee

Board and even in the event that Colombia had issued it, in no

way would the difficulties have been avoided which the lack

of the certificate would have caused the coffee trade of the

United States, since the United States had no legislation per- mitting the Custom houses to refuse entry to coffees not

covered by the said certificate.

3. It is alleged that the Association has reasons to believe

that Colombia permitted a dependency of the Government

to consign coffee to the United States in violation of Article

XVII. In this case the Association limits itself to gathering

[84]

rumors and therefore, since it barely has "reasons to believe”

that the said Article has been violated, it would be desirable

if concrete proofs would be presented in this respect setting

forth in what form there has been violation of Article XVII,

which estabhshes that the participating Governments agree

to maintain in so far as possible the normal and usual opera- tion of the coffee trade.

4. It is alleged that Colombia made possible an acute

shortage of coffee on the West Coast of the United States.

This is another allegation made without any solid founda- tion by the National Coffee ALSSociation, since it cannot well

be pretended that Colombia watches over the distribution of

coffee so that there will not arise shortages in the different

regions of the United States. This is beyond its control and

is the exclusive function of the importing trade and it is not

possible to hold the Governments responsible for shipping

difficulties, customs regulations, or other special circum- stances which may have prevented the trade in a given zone

of the United States from supplying itself adequately with

given types of coffee.

Colombia, then, in rejecting the charges made by the

Association, manifests her firm desire to support all measures

which may be necessary to strengthen the spirit and letter of

the Pact and to enforce strict compliance with its provisions.

MEMORANDUM

The Delegate of Guatemala wishes to inform that he

finds wholly unwarranted the statements, with reference

to Guatemala, made by Mr. George C. Thierbach, President

[85]

of the National Coffee Association, in a telegram addressed to

the Chairman of the Inter-American Coffee Board on July

9, 1941.

The Government of Guatemala has at all times enforced,

to the fullest extent of its laws, the obligations it accepted

under the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.

Whatever quantities of coffee from Guatemala arrived

in the United States, in excess of the authorized quota, had

left Guatemala before the Agreement went into effect and

prior to the establishment of the legal sanctions created by

the Agreement, thereby creating a situation which was recog- nized as "unforeseen circumstances’* and consequently was

beyond the control of the Government of Guatemala.

The Government of Guatemala has always and will al- ways respect its obligations, and is willing to live up to those

emanating out of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. To

further its desire to cooperate fully in its proper execution,

it is preparing at the present time new legislation which, in

the light of the experience obtained in the first year of quota,

will undoubtedly bring about a more orderly distribution

and exportation of the coffee which the Republic of Guate- mala is entitled to export under the Agreement hereinabove

mentioned.

STATEMENT REGARDING

ENTRY OF COFFEE SAMPLES

The Inter-American Coffee Board has been informed

that some importers of coffee in the United States have en- countered difficulty in receiving samples of the coffee they

intend to import, due to the closing of the corresponding

quota. Similarly, some concerns operating roasting establish- ments in Canda, who customarily examine and cup-test in

New York samples of coffee destined for roasting in Canada,

have found it difficult to continue this normal operation in

cases where the corresponding coffee quota has been closed.

The Inter-American Coffee Agreement was intended to

accomplish certain specified objectives through the estab- lishment of a quota system without interfering any more

than might be necessary with the usual and normal operation

of the coffee trade. Article XVII of the Coffee Agreement,

which formally establishes this principle, reads as follows:

**The participating Governments agree to

maintain, in so far as possible, the normal and usual

operation of the coffee trade.”

In view of the clear purpose and intent of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, and the fact that the quotas

established therein are intended to cover only coffee entered

for actual consumption, the Inter-American Coffee Board ex- presses the opinion that the entry of samples for testing pur- poses may properly be considered as falling outside the scope

[88]

APPENDIX No. 15

Meeting No. 10

July 24, 1941

of the quotas and accordingly may be permitted even in

cases where the corresponding quota has been closed.

It is apparent that if this procedure is to be adopted ade- quate safeguards must be established by regulation in order

to prevent abuses. The Board is confident that practical

measures of accomplishing the objective may be adopted

without in any way weakening the strict enforcement of

the quotas.

[89]

resolution urging MAINTENANCE OF MARI- TIME FACILITIES FOR THE SHIPMENT OF

COFFEE TO THE UNITED STATES

WHEREAS:

1. Coffee is the most important single commodity im- ported by the United States from the other American repub- lics, and represents one of the basic articles of consumption in

the United States;

2. The economic welfare and prosperity of many of the

American republics depend in large measure on the coffee

trade;

3. Under the terms of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment over 97% of all imports of coffee into the United

States come from the other American republics;

4. The Inter-American Coffee Agreement is intended

to stabilize the coffee market on terms fair to producers and

consumers alike;

5. Uncertainties regarding the present and prospective

shipping facilities for transporting this important commodity

to the United States may create fear, undermine confidence

and promote speculation, to the detriment of the announced

purposes of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;

6. It is the announced policy of the Government of the

United States, as has been made clear in various public state- APPENDIX No. 16

Meeting No. 10

July 25, 1941

[90]

ments by ofEcials of that Government, to maintain so far as

possible, normal maritime communications between the

United States and the other American republics;

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

1. To request the Government of the United States to

exert every effort to maintain maritime facilities for the

movement of coffee to the United States market in sufEcient

volume to fill the quotas established under the provisions of

the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;

2. To recommend that, in the maintenance of adequate

shipping facilities, due recognition be given to the needs of

West Coast and Gulf ports, as well as Atlantic ports, in order

to avoid trade disturbances in the United States as well as in

the producing countries.

RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR AN EMERGENCY

INCREASE OF THE QUOTAS BY 209S^,

UNDER ARTICLE VIII

WHEREAS:

1. The preamble of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, which sets forth in general terms the broad objectives

of the Agreement, states that **it is necessary and desirable

to take steps to promote the orderly marketing of coffee, with

a view to assuring terms of trade equitable for both pro- ducers and consumers by adjusting the supply to demand”;

2. The statement by the Inter-American Coffee Board

of its pohcy regarding prices and consumption, dated April

17, 1941, reiterates that ”the purpose of the Inter-American

Coffee Agreement is to make possible the orderly marketing

of coffee under the extraordinary conditions which have re- sulted from the present world conflict”;

3. Recent developments in the coffee market of the

United States, which have been caused in some measure by

official acts not contemplated in the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement, threaten to disrupt orderly marketing conditions

and the normal business of coffee roasting establishments

throughout the United States, and are making it difficult

for many of these establishments to satisfy their normal re- quirements except on terms of trade considered inequitable;

4. Although it appears that stocks of coffee within the

United States may be ample at the present time, there is

[92]

reason to believe that these stocks are closely held, partly for

speculative purposes, with the result that there is a corre- sponding scarcity of coffee freely offered on equitable terms

in the United States market;

5. In certain individual cases roasters are confronted with

an actual scarcity of certain types of coffee due to the fact

that the corresponding quotas have been closed prior to the

arrival of shipments purchased by these roasters in good faith

for their normal requirements during the current quota year;

6. Article XVII of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment requires the participating governments to maintain, in

so far as possible, the normal and usual operation of the coffee

trade;

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

1. To increase, as of August 11, 1941, the quotas for

the United States market by a further increase of 20% of

the basic quotas, in accordance with the provisions of Article

VIII of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;

2. To approve the following table showing the basic

quotas for the United States market and the revised quotas

RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE GOVERNMENT

OF THE UNITED STATES TO LIMIT COFFEE

IMPORTS TO SHIPMENTS COVERED BY

AN EXPORT CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY

THE PRODUCING COUNTRY

WHEREAS:

1. Under date of May 15, 1941 the Inter-American

Coffee Board issued a statement condemning the practice of

exporting coffee destined for sale in countries other than the

United States and subsequently diverting this coffee for sale

within the United States market, and expressed its intention

to take effective steps to terminate this practice, in coopera- tion with the governments of the countries participating in

the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;

2. In spite of the efforts which have been made in pro- ducing countries to check this abuse, it appears that more

effective measures must be provided with the cooperation

of the Government of the United States;

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

To request the Government of the United States to

take such action as may be appropriate to limit the entry

of coffee for consumption in the United States to ship- ments for which the official document provided for in Article

VI of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement has been issued,

certifiying that the coffee is destined for the United States

market.

[95]

STATEMENT REGARDING MINIMUM PRICES

AND PORT STOCKS

The Inter-American Coffee Board has carefully studied

the operation of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, and

as a result of this study has arrived at certain conclusions

which, it is believed, will contribute materially to the success- ful operation of the Agreement in the future. Specifically,

the Board expresses the unanimous opinion of the delegates

to the effect that the future success of the Inter-American

Coffee Agreement is assured by the understanding which has

been reached on the following points.

Certain producing countries have deemed it necessary

or desirable, as a measure of internal administration, to estab- lish or maintain minimum prices in order to secure for coffee

producers the full benefits of the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement. The Board believes that, as a matter of policy

which will facilitate the smooth operation and administra- tion of the Agreement, any such minimum prices which

exist or which may be established in the future should not

be maintained or fixed at levels exceeding the market prices

for coffee which would exist under the normal operation of

the quota system in the absence of such minimum prices,

nor should they prevent normal price fluctuations, nor dis- turb the normal and usual operation of the coffee trade.

The Inter-American Coffee Board likewise considers that

those countries having adequate warehousing facilities in their

respective ports of shipment should maintain in those ports

[96]

stocks of coffee in quantities sufficient to satisfy the require- ments of the market, in order to facilitate the normal and

usual operation of the coffee trade.

In view of the unanimous agreement which has been

reached on the foregoing points, the Inter-American Coffee

Board believes that the successful operation of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement is assured, and that there will

be a normal and regular movement of coffee to the United

States on terms fair to producers and consumers alike.

RESOLUTION REGARDING RELATIONS WITH THE

OFFICE OF PRICE ADMINISTRATION OF THE

UNITED STATES

WHEREAS:

1. On December 11, 1941 the Office of Price Adminis- tration of the United States of America, taking account of

the present critical emergency situation, fixed a tentative list

of maximum prices for green coffee in the United States mar- ket, taking as a basis the prices which prevailed in New York

on December 8 of this year;

2. The Government of the United States has invited the

Inter-American Coffee Board to consider the problems

thereby created and to contribute its views regarding the best

methods of dealing with them;

3. The Inter-American Coffee Board, confronted by the

new situation which has been created, and cognizant of its

responsibilities, desires to lend its full cooperation in the study

of the problem, with the purpose of assuring the orderly

marketing of coffee in accordance with the purposes of the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement;

[100]

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

1. To establish immediate contact with the appropriate

officials of the Government of the United States in order to

study the new situation created by the present emergency,

taking into account the interests of the countries participat- ing in the Inter-American Coffee Agreement and their joint

responsibilities for the maintenance of orderly marketing

conditions on terms of trade equitable to producers as well

as consumers.

2. To recommend that consideration be given to the

possibility of taking F. O. B. prices, port of export, as the

basis for emergency measures of price control.

STATEMENT OF THE OFFICE OF PRICE ADMINIS- TRATION ADDRESSED TO THE BOARD IN

REGARD TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF

THE PRICE ORDER ON GREEN

COFFEE

OFFICE OF PRICE ADMINISTRATION

WASHINGTON, D. C.

A.

1. The issuance of a price order on green coffee by the

Office of Price Administration follows directly from the duty

of this Office of preventing any interference with the war

effort of the United States that might arise from price in- creases. It is essential to high civilian morale that the supply

of food be adequate and available to consumers at reasonable

prices. Coffee is one of the most essential of foods; among

adults it is the leading food beverage consumed in this coun- try and its stimulating character makes it especially desirable

in times of emergency.

2. In the last eighteen months the prices of green coffees

have shown very large increases, the prices of some grades

having more than doubled. Although prices seemed to have

become stabilized in the last month, the outbreak of the

war on December 7 created a situation in which the infla- tionary tendencies in the price of coffee might again be

intensified. Therefore, in order to prevent further infla- tionary increases, the price of coffee was frozen at the

levels prevailing on December 8.

APPENDIX No. 23

Meeting No. 21

December 26, 1941

[102]

3. Although the establishment of a price ceiling for

coffee was dictated by the lines of internal policy, it is clear

that such an action has international repercussions. It is

clear also that it is equally to the advantage of both the

exporting countries and the United States that the orderly

marketing of coffee be maintained under the ceiling order.

The cooperation of all parties is essential to this end, and

it is the opinion of the Office of Price Administration that

such cooperation can best be implemented by contact be- tween the Office of Price Administration and the Inter- American Coffee Board.

B.

4. In line with this policy representatives of the Office

of Price Administration met with Mr. Paul Daniels, repre- senting the Inter-American Coffee Board, on December 22.

At this meeting Mr. Daniels presented several factors which

the Board felt should be considered in the revision of the

price schedule on green coffee. These considerations are dis- cussed in the five paragraphs immediately following.

5. It has been suggested that the ceiling prices be based

on a fixed price f.o.b. export points. The Office of Price

Administration has no authority to fix prices anywhere ex- cept in this country. However, sufficient flexibility in the

ceiling price to take care of increases in freight, marine in- surance, and war risk insurance rates is desirable from sev- eral points of view. Also there is equity in the claim that

the producing countries should not bear the burden of such

increases, since these rates are beyond the control of the pro- ducing countries. With these considerations in mind, the

Office of Price Administration has inserted in the draft of

the amendment to Price Schedule No. 50 (Subsection 1351.1

(g), a copy of which has been forwarded, a provision which

has the effect of establishing fixed prices f.o.b. export points.

[103]

6. Another consideration offered by the Board relates to

cost of production. The estimation of cost of production

data for agricultural products is extremely difficult. How- ever, since fixed costs are such a large proportion of the

total cost of production, it is hardly possible that unit costs

of producing coffee have risen to levels that are not more

than covered by the current level of ceiling prices. Until

such time as reliable data shows that payments to growers

have been increased in greater proportion than the increase

in coffee prices, an increase in the ceiling cannot be justified

on this basis.

7. A similar response is indicated in considering increases

in the prices of articles imported by the producing coun- tries from the United States. The ceiling prices currently

established offset by many times increases in prices of articles

exported from the United States. From data published by

the United States Department of Commerce, it is found

that from the first half of 1940 to July, 1941 (the last date

for which the information is published) the prices of fin- ished manufacturers exported from the United States have

shown no net increase. Prices of semi-manufacturers have

increased by only 8 percent. These classes form the bulk of

our exports to Latin America. Among the other export

product groups only the prices of manufactured foodstuffs

have increased as much as 20 percent. Against this the ceil- ing prices for Santos No. 4,and for Manizales are in the

neighborhood of 80 percent above their levels in the first

half of 1940. Further, the change in Brazil’s balance of

trade from an unfavorable to a substantially favorable one

has been attributed by Brazil to the increase in the price

of coffee.

8. The Board has suggested that the ceiling prices be

[104]

based on an average of prices over a period of time rather

than on the prices as of a single day. The objective of the

original schedule was to prevent the development of run- away prices in the coffee market. For this purpose, a date

preceding the development of the speculative advance is

fully as adequate as the use of any average price. Revisions

of the prices prevailing as of the freezing date, when basic

conditions warrant, have always been part of Office of Price

Administration policy. As to differentials, the amended

order contains the unanimous recommendations of the trade,

which reflect experience over an extended period of time.

9. Finally, the Board mentioned that the Office of Price

Administration consider allowing a 25-point tolerance above

the ceiling level. It is assumed that this recommendation

was aimed at securing more flexibility in the ceiling. This

has been attained by the amended order, which permits trad- ing above the ceiling in the event of increases in freight and

insurance.

10. Several courses of action are being followed by the

Office of Price Administration in order to maintain the

orderly marketing of coffee and to insure the maintenance

of trading and import in satisfactory volume. All of these

are at present embodied in the draft of the amendment to

Price Schedule No. 50, which is attached, and of these, two

are particularly important. The first is the provision ef- fecting flexibility in the price ceilings to cover increases in

freight and insurance rates. This is discussed in paragraph

5 above.

11. The second important amendment is in subsection

1351.1 (c) which extends the list of types and grades of

coffee for which specific ceilings are stated and which estab-

[105]

lishes differentials between these types somewhat different

from those established by the original price schedule. The

price differentials upon which the amended price schedule

is based were submitted to the Office of Price Administration

by representatives of all branches of the green coffee trade

at a meeting in New York on December 18. These repre- sentatives agreed unanimously upon the fairness of the dif- ferentials they submitted and pointed out that the differen- tials which had prevailed over a long period of time had

been considered. In the face of such unanimity and in view

of the fact that such differentials are in accord with the

analysis made by members of the staff of the Office of Price

Administration, it is believed that they should be embodied

in the amended schedule.

12. It is important to the coffee-producing countries and

to the United States that the free movement of coffee be

maintained at this time, particularly in view of the possi- bility that shipping shortages may limit shipments later in

the season. In these circumstances the Inter-American Cof- fee Board can contribute to the attainment of this objective

by continuing to bring to the attention of the Office of Price

Administration considerations affecting operation of the ceil- ing price schedule; and by continuing its adherence to the

principles expressed in previous resolutions and declarations,

particularly those of October 23, 1941. The Office of Price

Administration further suggests that the orderly marketing

and the continuation of a satisfactory volume of coffee trad- ing would be significantly assisted at this time by the issu- ance of a statement by the Board expressing the view that

the revised price order offers a sound basis for trading in

coffee under present conditions.

[106]

STATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING THE

REVISED ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF PRICE ADMIN- ISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES DATED

DECEMBER 27, 1941, ESTABLISHING NEW

PRICE SCHEDULE FOR GREEN COFFEE

In pursuance of the resolution approved by the Inter- American Coffee Board at its meeting of December 18,

1941, the Board has been in touch with the officials of the

United States Government concerned with emergency

measures of price control. This contact has afforded an

opportunity for certain considerations of importance to the

Board to be brought before these officials, as a contribution

to the study which has been made of this important problem.

In the revised order of the Office of Price Administration

of the United States, dated December 27, 1941, amending

and amplifying the preliminary order of December 11, the

Board has noted with gratification that its recommendations,

and specifically its resolution of December 18, have been

taken into account, and that in the new price schedule which

has been established coffee producers will be protected

against fluctuations in ocean freight rates and charges for

maritime insurance and war risk insurance over which they

have no control.

The Inter-American Coffee Board believes that the re- vised price schedule of December 27, 1941, establishes a

sound basis for trading in coffee under present conditions.

It is accordingly hoped that there will be a continuation

APPENDIX NO. 24

Meeting No. 21

December 26, 1941

[107]

of a satisfactory volume of coffee trading, in accordance with

previous resolutions and declarations of the Board, partic- ularly those of October 23, 1941. The Board is glad to lend

its cooperation in the dispelling of any uncertainties which

may have existed in regard to the current situation, and to

contribute its support to the reestablishment of a sound basis

for trading in the current emergency.

APPENDIX NO. 25

Meeting No. 23

February 24, 1942

RESOLUTION INCREASING QUOTAS FOR THE

UNITED STATES MARKET BY 5%

WHEREAS:

In view of the increasing consumption of coffee in the

United States market, it is necessary to adjust the supply of

coffee to estimated requirements.

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

1. To increase the quota for the United States market,

effective February 26, 1942, by 5 per cent of the basic

quotas, in accordance with Article III of the Inter-American

Coffee Agreement.

2. To communicate this resolution to the Governments

of the countries participating in the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement.

STATEMENT REGARDING INTENTION TO

REMOVE ALL RESTRICTIONS ON

ADVANCE SHIPMENTS

The Inter-American Coffee Board approved a resolu- tion on October 23, 1941, authorizing the shipment of coffee

from the producing countries to the United States during

the current quota year in excess of the established quotas,

up to a limit of 15%. In order to obviate any obstacle which

might interrupt the flow of coffee to the United States in

these times, the Board declares that it intends to remove

the limit of 15%, if it should become an obstacle. In this

manner it will be possible to take advantage, to the fullest

extent possible, of all available shipping space for the trans- portation of coffee to this market during the current quota

year, in accordance with the other provisions of the afore- said resolution.

LETTER ADDRESSED TO WAR SHIPPING ADMIN- ISTRATION REGARDING SUSPENSION OF

CONFERENCE RESTRICTIONS ON THE

SHIPMENT OF COFFEE DURING THE

EMERGENCY

March 12, 1942

My dear Admiral Land:

I enclose for your information a copy and translation of

a letter dated March 7, 1942, which I have received from

the Department of Coffee Exports of the Republic of El

Salvador, describing the difficulties recently experienced

there in shipping coffee to the United States because of the

continuation of the restrictions and limitations imposed by

the Camexco Freight Conference. For your further

information I am likewise enclosing a copy of my reply of

today’s date.

I believe you will agree that current conditions in the

field of maritime transportation are completely different

from those existing in normal times which justify the estab- lishment of shipping conferences and the limitations and

restrictions pertaining thereto. At the same time, it is

apparent that during these days it is a matter of paramount

importance, not only to the United States but to the coffee- producing countries, to take advantage of every available

inch of shipping space for the movement of cargo to this

country.

Accordingly, I should welcome an expression of your

views as to whether it would not be in the national interest

for the existing conference restrictions on the shipment of

coffee to the United States to be suspended for the duration

of the current shipping emergency. Such action would in

nowise involve any discussion of the conference principle in

general and its basic justification, but rather would be merely

an emergency measure to facilitate the movement of coffee

to the United States at a time when all shipping should be

used to the fullest extent possible.

Since this matter is of interest and importance to all

the coffee-producing countries, it would be preferable if

your reply to this inquiry could cover not only the Camexco

Freight Conference, but likewise any other shipping

conference engaged in the movement of coffee from the

other American republics to the United States.

Sincerely yours,

(Sgd.) Paul C. Daniels,

Chairman

DEPARTAMENTO DE EXPORTACIONES DE CAFE

Oficina de Control

San Salvador, El Salvador, C. A.

March 7, 1942.

My dear Mr. Daniels:

On February 16th a vessel flying the British flag arrived

at the port of Cutuco (La Union) to make repairs on its

engines. From the communication we had with the master

of this ship, we learned that it was nearly empty and that

[112]

its destination was San Francisco, Calif. We inquired whether

she could take on freight and he informed that he could

take some 35,000 bags of coffee for that destination if

anyone wished to export them.

Foreseeing the possibility that it might be under special

orders, our Government early the 17th contacted our Min- ister in Washington asking him to inquire and inform whe- ther the Maritime Commission and the British Naval Author- ities would consent to the utilization of the empty space on

the above-mentioned ship.

The following message was received from our Minister

early the 18th:

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY—SAN SALVADOR BRITISH MARI- TIME AUTHORITIES AND U. S. MARITIME COMMISSION MAKE NO

OBJECTION NOR REQUIRE CLEARANCE FOR CONTEMPLATED

COFFEE SHIPMENT ON BOARD SHIP OF J. C. WEBSTER AND SON,

SO ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE MADE THERE IF SPACE IS AVAILABLe!

CASTRO

We immediately contacted our Consul in San Fran- cisco, Calif., senor Ramirez, instructing him to request au- thorization from the CAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFER- ENCE in order that the ship in question, which does not

belong to any company affiliated with the Conference, might

load coffee without this being construed as a violation by

the exporters of their exclusive freight contracts with the

above-named Conference.

On the 19th we received the following message from

our Consul:

AGUSTIN ALFARO—SAN SALVADOR—I HAD DIFFICULTY IN TELE- PHONING TO INFORM THAT THE MATTER CONCERNING THE

SHIPMENT HAS BEEN SETTLED. PERMISSION WAS OBTAINED FROM

MARITIME CONFERENCE AUTHORIZING THE LOADING OF SAL-

[113]

VADOREAN SHIPMENT WHICH MUST BE MADE FROM LA UNION

AND LA LIBERTAD RESPECTIVELY. IMPORTERS ARE EXEMPT

FROM PENALTIES. GRACE COOPERATED EFFECTIVELY.

CONSALVA

As these steps were being taken, and since we could not

offer any assurance as to their success, the vessel finished its

repairs and sailed from Cutuco on the night of the 18th.

In view of this we requested that the corresponding author- ities sent a radiogram to the ship instructing it to return to

La Union, which message was sent according to information

received from our Consul in San Francisco. Since, as we

understand, all ships have orders not to act on messages re- ceived on the high seas, we awaited the return of the ship

for several days with the coffee on dock ready to load imme- diately. For one reason or another the ship did not return,

and the entire shipment is still at the port awaiting the

arrival of some ship sailing North. We wish to bring to

your attention the fact that the last ship sailing in that

direction which called at Cutuco came on February 4th last,

and that to this date we know of no other liner which is to

call at this port in the future.

Since then we have received correspondence from our

Consul in San Francisco, giving a detailed account of the

steps taken in that city, and find in our correspondence the

following letter from the Camexco:

'•CAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFERENCE—SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

FEBRUARY 19, 1942—HONORABLE JORGE RAMIREZ, CONSUL GEN- ERAL OF EL SALVADOR, RUSS BUILDING, SAN FRANCISCO, CALI- FORNIA.

DEAR MR. RAMIREZ: THIS WILL CONFIRM OUR TELEPHONE

CONVERSATION OF TODAY WHEREIN WE ADVISED YOU THAT

CAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFERENCE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SIGNA- TORIES TO ITS FREIGHTING AGREEMENTS USING FACILITIES OF

THE SS "MAGISTER”, A NON-CONFERENCE VESSEL NOW AT LA

UNION, EL SALVADOR, FOR THIS ONE VOYAGE, FOR THE TRANS-

[114]

PORTATION OF GREEN COFFEE FROM THE PORTS OF LA UNION

AND LA LIBERTAD, EL SALVADOR, TO NORTH PACIFIC COAST

PORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. WE TRUST THE

ACTION ON THE PART OF THIS CONFERENCE WILL BE OF SERVICE

TO YOU. YOURS VERY TRULY, (S) C R. KING, CHAIRMAN- SECRETARY.

As may be gathered from the letter quoted above, the

authorization for using ships belonging to companies which

are not affiliates of the Conference was granted only for the

particular case for which it was requested. We are, there- fore, still unable to utilize any space which might become

available if a ship not affiliated to the Conference should call,

since the request for permission takes time and it would not

be unlikely that, by the time the authorization is obtained, the

ship should have left our shores as in the case of the **MAG- ISTER”.

On this very date the selfsame situation has come up

again. We are acting in San Francisco to obtain authoriza- tion from the CAMEXCO to utilize the facilities offered by

an oil tanker to carry North from 15,000 to 18,000 bags.

Of course, in this case, besides the authorization of the Con- ference we must obtain that of the importers who, although

the holds of the ship are perfectly clean, might fear lest the

coffee should suffer by being stored near petroleum. Never- theless, it would be easier to operate if we had to consult

them only without having to wait until after the Confer- ence has given its decision.

We have taken the liberty of bringing to your attention

this lengthy exposition in order to acquaint you perfectly

with the circumstances, to see if there is anything which

might be done to alleviate the difficulties besetting maritime

transportation.

[115]

We believe that the Conference should be less exacting

in these times of emergency, inasmuch as it is not able to

serve the ports of these countries regularly with ships of its

affiliated companies. Moreover, aside from the transporta- tion of coffee, it is a pity to see ships with available space,

wasting time, fuel and money—precious in these moments—

while shipments are left along their route, which might

easily be transported were it not for hindrances and obli- gations which, however justifiable they may be in normal

times of close competition, are obstacles in crises so acute as

the present one.

In other words, we would desire that efforts be made

to obtain full authorization from the Maritime Conferences

to employ all facilities which may be available for the trans- portation of freight which lies in wait for ships in our ports.

In various instances recommendations have been made to

the producing countries to take advantage of all shipping

facilities to ship to the United States as much coffee as pos- sible in the briefest time possible. We are trying to coop- erate in every way towards that end, and, for that reason,

are anxious to eliminate the difficulties which exist by reason

of technicalities.

With expressions of our highest consideration and per- sonal esteem, we are.

Yours very truly,

MEMORANDUM OF CHAIRMAN REGARDING POS- SIBLE CONTINUATION OF INTER-AMERICAN

COFFEE AGREEMENT BEYOND

OCTOBER 1, 1943

April 17, 1942.

To the Delegates to the Inter-American Coffee Board:

Article XXIV of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement

reads as follows:

‘‘Subject to the eventuality covered by Article XXV,

the present Agreement shall remain in force until October

1, 1943.

Not less than one year prior to October 1, 1943, the

Board shall make recommendations to the participating

Governments as to the continuation or otherwise of the

Agreement. The recommendations, if in favor of con- tinuation, may suggest amendments to the Agreement.

Each participating Government shall signify to the

Board its acceptance or rejection of the recommendations

referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph within

six months after the date of the receipt of such recom- mendations. This period may be extended by the Board.

If said recommendations are accepted by all the par- ticipating Governments, the participating Governments

undertake to take such measures as may be necessary to

carry out said recommendations. The Board shall draw

APPENDIX NO. 29

Meeting No. 26

April 29, 1942

[118]

up a declaration certifying the terms of said recommenda- tions and their acceptance by all the participating Gov- ernments, and the present Agreement shall be deemed to

be amended in accordance with this declaration as from

the date specified therein. A certified copy of the decla- ration together with a certified copy of the Agreement as

amended shall be communicated to the Pan American

Union and to each of the participating Governments.

The same procedure for making amendments or for

the continuation of the Agreement may be followed at

any other time.”

The foregoing Article, and the procedure which it con- templates, make it necessary to give attention to two major

problems in connection with the possible renewal of the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement: (1) possible changes in

the substance of the Agreement; and (2) the legal prob- lems presented in effecting any changes in the Agreement

or in continuing the Agreement without change.

With respect to the first point, namely, possible changes

in the substance of the provisions of the Agreement, it is

suggested that each Delegate present to the Board not later

than at the ordinary session of the Board on July 7, his

recommendations regarding possible changes in the substance

and text of the Agreement.

With reference to the second point, the views of each

participating Government should be ascertained and made

known to all of the Delegates as soon as possible. In this

connection consideration should be given, I believe, to the

following points:

[119]

1. If the Inter-American Coffee Board recommends

to each participating Government that the Agreement be

continued for a specified or unspecified period beyond

October 1, 1943, without any change whatsoever, will it

be necessary for each Government to re-submit the Agree- ment to the National Congress with a view to obtaining

Congressional approval?

2. If the Board recommends continuation of the

Agreement with only very slight changes of a purely

phraseological character, not involving any substantive

change in the Agreement, would submission to the Con- gress be necessary?

3. If the Board should recommend the continuation

of the Agreement with important changes of substance,

would Congressional approval be necessary?

No doubt other questions of a legal or technical char- acter will arise in connection with the possible renewal of

the Coffee Agreement, but it would be most convenient if

the foregoing questions could be answered at once. Each

of the participating Governments has a direct and immediate

interest in the legal and procedural problems which may be

confronted in all of the other countries, because we all have

a common interest in the Agreement. If difficulties should

be encountered of a legal or procedural character, causing

a lapse in the legal force of the Agreement, a most unfor- tunate situation might arise. Accordingly, I urge that this

important problem be studied urgently by each Delegate in

order that the views of all the participating Governments

may be made known to all of us at the earliest possible date.

their points of view regarding the application of the mech- anism established in Article XXIV in relation to the consti- tutional requirements of their respective countries, replying

specifically to the following questions:

1. If the Inter-American Coffee Board should rec- onunend to each one of the participating Governments

that the Agreement be continued for a definite or indefi- nite time after October 1, 1943, without changes of any

kind, will it be necessary for each Government again to

submit the Agreement to the National Congress for ap- proval?

[122]

2. If the Board should recommend that the Agree- ment be continued with slight modifications of phrase- ology but not of substance, would it be necessary to submit

it to Congress?

3. If the Board should recommend the continuation

of the Agreement with important changes of substance,

would it be necessary to obtain the approval of the Con- gress?

STATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING EMER- GENCY INCREASE OF THE COFFEE QUOTAS

FOR THE UNITED STATES MARKET

The Inter-American Coffee Board at its regular meet- ing held today approved an emergency increase of the coffee

quotas for the United States market, with the understanding

that this increase is to apply solely to the current quota year

and that at the commencement of the next quota year the

quotas will be adjusted so as to correspond with the esti- mated requirements of the United States market. As a

result coffees which have arrived from a few countries in

excess of the existing quotas may be released from customs

supervision and entered for immediate consumption.

The immediate effect of this resolution will be to relieve

certain coffee importers of small storage charges on these

coffees which otherwise would be held in warehouse under

customs supervision until next October 1. While these

charges are a relatively minor item in the cost of coffee,

the Board feels that everything possible should be done to

remove any unnecessary or avoidable charges on the coffee

trade during these difficult times.

At no time, now or hitherto, have the quotas estab- lished by the Inter-American Coffee Agreement had the

effect of preventing the shipment of coffee from producing

countries to the United States. On the contrary, they

have had the effect of greatly stimulating such shipments,

which in 1941 reached the highest level in history. Advance

shipments on next year’s quota to an unlimited amount

were authorized by the Board in its resolution of April 29,

APPENDIX NO. 32

Meeting No. 30

July 15, 1942

[124]

1942. Accordingly, no increase in the amount of coffee

shipped to the United States will result from the current

increase of the quotas, but such coffee as does arrive will

be more readily available for special uses and with somewhat

less cost to the importers.

It is impossible for the Board to predict at this time

whether or not a similar increase of the quotas will be nec- essary or desirable before the end of the next quota year.

The decision will be made at that time on the basis of facts

and conditions as they then exist, particularly in regard to

the shipping situation. It is the Board’s avowed intention

to maintain the basis for the orderly marketing of coffee

established by the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, and

the action taken today is to be construed as evidence of the

Board’s desire to adapt itself to emergency conditions rather

than as any change in its basic policy.

The newly established quotas for the current quota year

ending next September 30 are as follows;

Country Quota

Brazil 13,772,990

Colombia 4,668,142

Costa Rica 296,242

Cuba 118,888

Dominican Republic 177,835

Ecuador 222,377

El Salvador 935,779

Guatemala 793,042

Haiti 407,241

Honduras 31,689

Mexico 729,072

Nicaragua 309,152

Peru 37,022

Venezuela 431,527

[125]

RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AN EMERGENCY

INCREASE OF THE QUOTAS FOR THE

UNITED STATES MARKET

WHEREAS:

1. The current lack of shipping facilities to transport

coffee from the producing countries to the United States

in volume sufficient to satisfiy the requirements of the United

States market has created a shortage of coffee in the United

States market.

2. By virtue of a resolution approved April 29, 1942,

the Inter-American Coffee Board provided for advance

shipments of coffee in excess of existing quotas, such excess

shipments to be charged against next year’s quota but to be

stored under customs supervision until the beginning of

the next quota year.

3. The measures referred to in paragraph 2 above have

made possible the continuous and uninterrupted flow of cof- fee to the United State in so far as the provisions of the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement are concerned, but the

existing prohibition against the entry of these excess coffees

for immediate consumption causes small additional storage

charges for the account of the trade and may prevent the

prompt and uninterrupted movement of these coffees into

the channels of distribution.

4. It is desirable during this period of emergency to

administer the provisions of the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement with all possible flexibility, in order to eliminate

APPENDIX NO. 33

Meeting No. 30

July 15,1942

[126]

any unnecessary inconvenience or expense to the coffee trade

or the consuming public at large.

5. It is essential, however, to maintain the procedure

for orderly marketing established by the Inter-American

Coffee Agreement, particularly in Articles I and III thereof,

and accordingly the emergency quota readjustment ap- proved by this resolution is solely for the current quota

year.

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

THEREFORE RESOLVES:

1. To increase the quotas for the United States market

as of July 16, 1942, to 277% of the basic quotas, in accord- ance with Article VIII of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, so that the quotas for the current year will be as

follows:

Country Quota*

Brazil 13,772,990

Colombia 4,668,142

Costa Rica 296,242

Cuba 118,888

Dominican Republic 177,835

Guatemala 793,042

Haiti 407,241

Honduras 31,689

Mexico 729,072

Nicaragua 309,152

Peru 37,022

Venezuela 431,527

• Adjustments have been made for over-and undershipments during the quota year

1940-1941.

[127]

2. To readjust the quotas for the United States market,

as of October 1, 1942, so that they will be 110% of the

basic quotas, in accordance with Article VIII of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement.

3. To communicate copies of this resolution to the

Governments participating in the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement.

Meeting No. 33

August 5, 1942

STATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING OBLI- GATIONS OF PRODUCING COUNTRIES IN

ISSUING EXPORT CERTIFICATES UNDER

ARTICLE VI OF THE AGREEMENT

Under the provisions of the Inter-American Coffee

Agreement the Governments of the countries participating

in the Agreement have accepted certain responsibilities.

These responsibilities must be carefully and accurately car- ried out if the Agreement is to be administered with success

and contribute effectively to the orderly marketing of coffee.

Among these responsibilities are included those derived from

Article VI of the Agreement which read as follows:

"Each producing country participating in this

Agreement shall take all measures necessary on its part

for the execution and operation of this Agreement and

shall issue for each coffee shipment an official document

certifying that the shipment is within the correspond- ing quota fixed in accordance with the provisions of

this Agreement.”

In accordance with the foregoing Article each producing

country should issue export certificates for each shipment

of coffee exported from that country, whether to the

United States under Article I or to the market outside the

United States under Article II. The Inter-American Coffee

Board recommends to each Government that great care be

exercised in issuing such certificates, in order to guarantee

the effective administration of the quotas and smooth oper- ation of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.

[131]

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article VI of the

Inter-American Coffee Agreement there have been a few

instances where the export certificates referred to above

have been issued to an amount in excess of the correspond- ing quota as fixed by the Inter-American Coffee Board In

such cases losses and inconveniences have been incurred by

coffee traders. The Inter-American Coffee Board sincerely

regrets any losses or inconveniences which have been or may

be incurred by either exporters or importers as the result

of the improper issuance of export certificates. The Board

recommends that in any such cases the interested parties

communicate directly with the proper officials in the ex- porting country with a view to seeking relief, and is confi- dent that through direct arrangements of this character

equitable and mutually satisfactory solutions may be reached.

RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING CONTINUATION

OF INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE AGREEMENT

WITHOUT CHANGE FOR AN ADDI- TIONAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR

WHEREAS:

1. In accordance with Article XXIV of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement the Inter-American Coffee

Board is charged, before the 1st of October of the present

year, with making recommendations to the participating

Governments with respect to the convenience or otherwise

of continuing in effect the said Agreement;

2. The Inter-American Coffee Agreement has pro- duced results which have been beneficial for the interests

of the participating countries, and present circumstances

render advisable, for the common benefit, the continuation

of the Agreement in order to avoid the disorderly condi- tions which without the functioning of the Agreement would

inevitably arise in the coffee market;

3. To re-open at this time the discussion between the

signatory countries to introduce changes in the text of the

Agreement would seriously compromise—in the judgment

of the Board—the renewal of the Agreement;

THE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD

RESOLVES:

1. To recommend to the participating Governments

the continuation without any change of the Inter-American
