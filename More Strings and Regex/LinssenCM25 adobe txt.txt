The text of this book was submitted as a dissertation, written under the supervision of Prof. dr. M. Stol and Prof. dr. R.J. van der Spek, in November 2002 to the Faculty of Arts of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I would like to thank Marten Stol and Bert van der Spek for showing a genuine interest in my dissertation. Their comments and corrections on the different versions of the text saved me from numerous errors. I am grateful for their continuous support and patience, including during the years after I had left the university. The Trustees of the British Museum are thanked for permitting me to collate and publish texts from the collection. During my visits to the British Museum W.G. Lambert kindly offered me much needed advise with the reading of some of the unpublished tablets. I am also indebted to several scholars at the University of Leiden. Th.J.H. Krispijn helped me with many 0£ t4e lamentation incipits. A.C.V.M. Bongenaar made some valuable comments on the manuscript. Special tribute is due to G. van Driel for his help and advice. A.R. George kindly allowed me to use his article on temple ritual texts from Babylon before it was published. St. M. Maul suggested to me how useful A. Poebel's Grundzuge der sumerischen Grammatik still is, when struggling with the difficult Sumerian passages in Hellenistic texts. I also wish to express my gratitude to D. Brown for correcting the English text. Research for this study, carried out at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, was financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (N.W.0.) from February 1992 until February 1997. A special word of thanks I owe to the editor, G. Haayer, for accepting this study for publication. ' Edam, December 2002 M.J.H. Linssen vii CONTENTS

INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Hellenistic Babylonia l'he continuation of Babylonian culture in the Hellenistic period! is well establishec;i today. Work done by scholars like L. T. Doty, G.J.P.McEwan, A. Kuhrt, S. Sherwin-White, J. Oelsner and R.J. van der Spek2 has shown that not only Uruk and Babylon, but also other Babylonian cities (Nippur, Larsa, Ur, Borsippa, Cutha and KiM:;lursagkalamma)3 flourished after the coming of the Greeks. Both archaeology and textual sources indicate that in these cities the Babylonian inhabitants ft_tuck to their ancient traditions, which included the use of cuneiform. Whether Akkadian was still used as a living language in the Hellenistic period is uncertain_, 4 but on the basis of the so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca tablets and Classical sources:it has been argued that cuneiform could well have been read up to the third century A.o.s. The cuneiform sources also contain a wealth of information on the Babylonian cults and the temples in the Hellenistic period. It is the purpose of this study to examine these cults more closely and present an inventory of all attested cultic activities. The key question will be: gm we use the temple rit1.1a.Ltexts..as evidence forHellenistic cult practices? To answer this question we cannot restrict our research to the temple ritual texts alone; because these texts are literary compositions copied from older originals, we cannot be sure that what they depict about the public cult was actually taking place in the temples during the Hellenistic period. For this reason we will not only analyse the ritual texts in detail, but also compare the evidence with inform¨.9p_gl~~9._from t~ which are ffilfil~~~P.l~!J.!81,tex.t¤l,ypguestionably Hellenistic composition~, such as building inscriptioll¤, legal documents (including prebend texts), chronicles and the so-called ~ITQ!!2..II.Y£al Which rituals, ceremonies and offerings are attested in diari_e.s. these texts? Which deities and temples are mentioned, and does the pantheon attested in these texts correspond with the names of gods mentioned in the temple ritual texts? This comparison will hopefully tell us whether the cults of Bel, Anu, !star and the other 1 Because one of the most important characteristics of the Babylonian culture, the cuneiform script, survives not only during the Seleucid yeriod, but also well into the Arsacid period, we will use in this book the more general term 1Hellenistic , which begins with the conquest of Babylonia by Alexander in 331 B.C. and continues up to the end of the Arsacid period (224/226 A.D. ). Cf. J. Oelsner,Materia/ien,51=57.Onoccasion we will also refer to texts as being 'Late Babylonian', which in this study means: written after Babylonia lost its independence (539 B.C.), i.e. during the Achaemenid or Hellenistic periods. 2 See the Selective Bibliography. 3 Perhaps also Marad, Der, Tell al-'Aqar, Udannu, Telloh and Sippar, see R.J. van der Spek, in: Maria de Jong-Ellis ( ed.), Nippur at the Centennial, 235ff.; id.,Re/igieuze en economische po/itiek in het Se/eucidische Rijk, 11 ff. 4¥ According to M.P. Streck (Zahl und Zeit, Groningen, 1995, xxiv), the possibility that (together with Aramaic) theáAkkadian language was still spoken in small city regions in the Hellenistic period cannot be excluded. s M.J. Geller, ZA 87 (1997), 43-95. 1 
deities were alive and flourishing in the Hellenistic perio~ or whether, perhaps under 
the influence of the new Macedonian rulership, a process of change and decay had set 
Ill. Because the textual evidence relating to the cults in the Hellenistic period concerns for the most part the main sanctuaries of Uruk (Re¤ and E¤gal) and Babylon (Esagila), in this study we will confine ourselves to the cults of these two cities, although it should be noted that this undoubtedly results in a slightly distorted picture of Hellenistic Babylon.i.!! as a whole. á In 1.2 the text material relevant for this study is discussed. In 1.3 we will make somt: general observations about the cult, the priests and templepersonnel and the cµIt-terminology. In chapter II all the ceremonies, rimru,[JJ.ud..JestiY.als~tte~ the Hellenistic cornus w.ilLh.egewjhed. In chapter III we will analyse the o_fferings2.. libations, fumigations, and purifications which were performed during the divine meal. Much has been written on religion and cults in Mesopotamia, but only a few studies 
concentrated on the Hellenistic period. Exceptions are Furlani 's studies on offerings and 
9eremonies, 6 and Blome's analysis of the offeriqg material¤/ which to a large extent 
are based on texts from the Hellenistic period. Since the publication of these books in 
the 1930's, much new evidence has been discovered and published. This was used in a 
limited way much later by McEwan in his disse.!!!tion on the temple organization anft 
the_J:~!_llple chapter on the cult. 8 As
personnel of H_£lleni~tic B~bylonii!, wifu_Qp.£_¤hm:.t_ the author indicated himself, however this was only a 'limited outline of the main aspects of the cult during this period'. 9 Other scholars took an interest in the cults of Hellenistic Babylonia. A short description of the gods and cult ofUruk was written by Rutten. 10 Furthermor{schroeder published an article oq the pantheon of Ur~} 1 Falkenstein wrote an important study on the topography of Uruk, which concentrates to a large extent on the cultic buildings, and contains much important information on the cult; 12 this work has now partly been updated by Georgel3 and Pongratz-Leisten. 14 Beaulieu's article on the origin of the Anu.pantheon in Late Babylonian Uruk is important.15 Finally, Konstanze Szelenyi-Graziotto published an article on the cult in Babylon in the Seleucid period.16 Nevertheless, an extensive a.Qalysis of the Hellenistic cults of Babylonia, based on the latest evidence, is still missing. A new discussion is necessary. 6 Sacrificio; Riti. 7 Opfermaterie. s FAOS4, 159-182. 9 159. 10 Controls de l'epoque seleucide conserves au Musee du Louvre, 36--63. tr11 SPAW41 (1916), ll80-II96. 12 Topographie. t3 BIT.

1.2. The texts I.2. The textsl7 The temple ritual texts are especially relevant for studying the Babylonian cults, since they give us the most detailed information on public cult activities in the sanctuaries of the cities. 18 These texts contain prescriptive rituals, recording what happened in the temple before the events in question, as a manual of ritual procedure. 19Fortunately for the Hellenistic period a large corpus of these often very elaborate ritual texts is available.20 They deal with instructions for all sorts of cultic proceedings, such as offerings and libations for the gods, and also prescribe prayers and cult songs which haveá to be recited; sometimes these recitations are not only referred to by their incipits, but are cited in full. The rituals deal with various subjects of the public cult, such as the :fiew :Y~lH' f~l, the night vigil, the preparation of the kettledrum, building rituals for temples, and-the evil consequences of an eclipse of the moon. This group of temple ritual texts will serve as the main sáource material for this studyá Other relevant text groups, already collected by J. Oelsner,21 are the explanatory and commentary texts,22 cult songs,23 calendar texts,24 but also building inscriptions, chronicles, administrative documents, 25 17 For the bibliographic information"on the texts mentfoned here see the Text Index. 18 For Akkadian ritual texts in general, see J.J.A. van Dijk, in: Studien Falkenstein, 233 ff.; R. Borger, HKL

19 Rather than descriptive rituals, which are written after the events, and describe cultic events in the temple 
mainly for the purpose of recording cul tic expenditures, cf. B.A. Levine, W.W.Hallo, HUCA 3 8 ( 1967), 1 7-20. 
20 Some of which have been published only recently, while for others older editions are available, in particular 
Thureau-Dangin's excellent study of temple ritual texts in RAcc. In the Appendix, some of these texts will 
be discussed anew. Also a few new fragments will be published in this book, for which see the Plates I-IV. 
When passages from these texts are quoted in this study, we confine ourselves to translations, and refer back 
to the Appendix for the transliterations and discussions.

22 Not listed as a separate group by Oelsner, but see p. I 88 where some commentary texts from Uruk are 
mentioned. For explanatory texts and cultic commentaries in general see A. Livingstone, Mystical, 2 (for the 
distinction between the two) and especially 115 ff., chapters 4--6.Cf. also W.von Soden, ZA 51 (1955), 157,

Uruk: the explanatory text TU 47, containing important information on the mythical background of the kettledrum ritual (lilissu); commentaries are SpTU 1, nos. 140---143; see also no. 136. Babylon: BM 54312 (unpublished). In this explanatory text days 5 to I I of the first month Nisannu are discussed, and therefore it possibly refers to the New Year festival. Unfortunately the tablet is badly damaged and the interpretation is difficult. The small script indicates that the text is Late Babylonian, possibly Hellenistic. Because of the invocational formula [ina INIM c!EN]u dQASAN-ici lis-lim (U.E.), only attested in Late Babylonian colophons (see the literature mentioned in my comments on TU 39 U.E., in the Appendix), the text may be from Babylon. We will return to this text in a separate study. Another explanatory text, perhaps from Borsippa but found in Babylon, is BM 34035 {Sp I 131). The text partly explains rituals in terms of myths, by making use of symbolism. A large explanatory text, IM 44150 (+//),was published by George (BTT, no. 18, 145 ff.). Of the five manuscripts, two or possibly three are Late Babylonian, and, because of the very small script, perhaps Hellenistic (cf. TIM 9, p. xii.). Col. III, 12'ff. deals with festivals, one of which is the akftu-festival. 23 I.e. hymns and lamentations. In addition to Oelsner, we can add: hymns, Uruk: SpTU 2 no. 27 (to Istar), and BiMes 24, 51 (to Adad). See also the hymn on Sama¤ in the ritual text W 18828. Lamentations (taqribtu and ersemakku), Uruk: Sp TU 3, nos. 61---63; Sp TU 4, no. 125, contains part of the lamentation IMMAL GUDEDE. 24 In addition to Oelsner, we can add: Uruk: SpTU 3, no. 104, written by the well-known scribe Iqisa, is a calendar text for the 4th month Du1uzu; it lists body parts of animals for every day, probably to be used in ritual activities. For the latest on IqI¤a see J. Oelsner, in: J. Zablocka, St. Zawadzki {eds.), Sulmu IV, 236--7, with literature. 25 In addition to Oelsner, we can add: apart from isolated publications, especially important is BiMes 24. A new group of texts was published by R. Wallenfells, Seleucid archival texts in the Harvard Semitic Mus.eum. Not yet published by L.T. Doty is YOS 20. I. Introduction and astronomical diaries.26 Classical authors like Diodurus Siculus, Strabo, Josephus or Berossus (to name just a few) are important for reconstructing the political history, but are less informative so far as the Babylonian cult practices are concerned When studying the cults we are faced with several problems. While some of the ceremonies and rituals are well attested, about others we know only very little, and undoubtedly many more must have existed about which we know nothing at all. Because the Neo-Assyrian period has left us with many ritual texts, on occasion we will refer to some of these texts for parallels, because we may safely assume a c_Qill!!l..QP. background hl<?Q!_~a!_!_~i-~a]?y]Qp,_i@ __cl.!11.PJ~ces. However, a comparison betweeii the two is not without difficulties, and it is clear that we are far from explaining the gaps in our knowledge of one period by looking at the other. Nevertheless, although many texts contain rituals for a special occasion, it must be expected that many of the offerings, libations, fumigations, purifications and recitations referred to in these texts reflect the common practice of the-ordinary_ temple cult.27 As far as the Neo-Babylqnian period is concerned, we must keep in mind that relevant Ne~abylonian references to the cults are often not from ritual texts, but from administrative an<lprivate documents. Another problem is that many of the texts do not give us the infonnation that we need: the texts often only record the ceremony, without explaining how and when it was performed, and what its function was. This makes it often very difficult to distinguish cyclical ceremonies from occasional ceremonTes:It also leaves us insufficient data to compare and combine Assyrian and-Babylonian cultic calendars. In this section we will first list the temple ritual texts from Uruk and Babylon. Then the date of the texts is discussed. .. Uruk We can distinguish three groups of literary texts, distinct according to provenance, and ' dated to the Hellenistic period28 : 1) the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts. Most of these texts were found in the Res-temple area 
Le XVI 3.29 
2) Hellenistic texts in TU. They were illicitly excavated and have become available via 
the antiquities market, but were probably found either at the same location in the 
.. 26 Up to now four volumes of the astronomical diaries have appeared, cf. A.J.Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries. 27 Cf. G. van Oriel, Cult of Assur, 151--4. The most relevant texts for the Neo-Assyrian cult are briefly discussed in ib., 51 ff. Important for the monthly ceremonies is also the hemerological series inbu be! arbim '.,Pnut (=epithet of the moon god Sin), Lord of the month'; unfortunately only the description by B. Lar,nlsberger,Kull. Ka/ender, 100--45 is available, since most of the texts are not published. See also the 
conunents on this series by G. van Oriel, Cult of Assur, 154=59, R. Labat, in RLA 4 (1972-1975), 319f.,

28 The material was brought together by J. Oelsner, Materialien, 139 ff.; see also id., in: J. Zablocka, St.

Res-temple area as the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts,3¡ or they came from other locations within the Res-temple.31 3) 	Hellenistic texts in the SpTU 1-5-collection. They were almost all excavated from the living quarters Ue XVIII 1, and are part of private archives. Other illicitly excavated tablets may also have come from one of these places, as is indicated by the fact that Uruk scribes, attested for example in the colophons of BRM 4-texts, also turn up in the TU-and SpTU-texts (see below). These texts can be attributed to four Uruk families, named after their ancestors Ekur.zakir, Sin-leqe-unnrni, ijunzft and Abutu. These families were all connected with the temple and every family specialized in one profession, e.g. the Ekur-zakir members made their living as exorcists (asipu);well-known are the exorcists Anu-ik~ur, lqisa and Nidintu-Anu. The Sin-leqe-unnini family specialized as lamentation priests (kalu); well.kiiownis especially Anu-belsunu.l son of Nidintu-Anu.3 2 Rarely, !!~ember¤. of otJ:wr families are attested as kaiu or asipu,e.g. the exorcist Anu-belsunu 5>f the ijunzu-fa1!!}ly The archives which can be reconstructed on the basis of prosopographical evidence contain a wide variety of text genres, but also show the scribe's particular professional interest: the exorcist is mainly concerned with incantations and incantation rituals, medical texts, omina and lexical lists, while the lamentation priest concentrates especially 9n cult song and ritual texts. The libraries of these scribes also contain other literary texts, referred to by Oelsner as 'Bildungsgut' ,33 i.e. texts which.were copied for educational purposes, e.g. omina, historical texts, but also, for example, parts from Eniima elis. We may safely assume that the archives contain not only what the scribe needed for his profession, but also everything he had collected from the start of his career on. This also included legal documents, which are not only known from the SpTU-corpus, but also among the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts found in Le XVI 3. This may indicate that not only the texts which are found in the living quarters Ue XVIII 1 were part of private archives, but also those which were stored in the Res-temple.34 There appears, then, to be no real difference between the archives kept in the temple and at home. The scribes appear to have stored their tablets both in the Res-temple libraries (TU, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2) and in the libraries in their private houses (SpTU). E.g. texts which belong to the archives of the exorcist lqisa, son of Istar-suma-eres, descendant of Ekur-zakir, or to those of the exorcist Nidintu-Anu, son of Anu-begunu, descendant ofEkur-zakir, have turned up from both the Res-temple area and the living quarters Ue XVIII,35This strongly suggests that the Hellenistic temple ritual texts were 3"' J. van Dijk, UVB 18 (1962), 43, id.,AJD20 (1963), 217.

not copied for personal interest alone, but also served a purpose in the temple cult (we will further illustrate this below). With this in mind we must now turn our attention to the temple ritual texts. For the Hellenistic period we are fortunate to have some large fragments of a series of temple rituals from Uruk, which inform us about the public cult practices in the temples. The original series must have covered the whole year.36 These temple ritual texts contain information about what went on from day to day, or describe rituals and festivals which were celebrated on special days of the year. Most of the temple ritual texts of the Hellenistic period deal with the cult of Anu in the Res-temple, and only one text is related to the cult of !star in the Es gal-temple. Texts which belong to these series all have in common the fact that the priests who perform the ritual are addressed in the third person only, unlike rituals which are performed for a special occassion, where the leading priest is addressed in the second person (the 'you'-figure). Very important for our understanding of daily practice in the temple is TU 38, a text with ritual instructions for daily offerings in the temples of Anu, mar, Nanaja and the other gods in Uruk. Furthermore we have several texts which concern the New Year festival (akftu). _TU 39-40 describes the New Year festival of the seventh month Tasritu in Uruk. BRM 4, 7 describes a programme for the procession of the statue of Anu during the New Year festival, from his cella to the center of the Res-temple, and then going outside to the akftu-temple. It lists incantations and prayers to be recited during the procession. We also have texts dealing with the New Year festivals of the first month Nisannu. KAR 132 describes the ritual for the procession of Anu to the akftu-temple, concentrating on the movements of the gods and the objects which accompany them during the procession. Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 13 is a fragment describing a procession of the gods similar to KAR 132. TU 43, a fragment of a ritual for the New Year festival of the month Nisannu, contains a hand-raising prayer (suillakku) for Anu; this text gives us more information on day 10 and 11 of this festival. á Another important text is TU 42 +: the text describes a festival for !star; and must have belonged to a larger series of temple ritual texts dealing with the cult of !star of Uruk. In which month this festival was celebrated is not clear. The obverse records the same ceremonies, which for days 8 and 9 of the New Year festival of Anu are also preserved (see TU 39-40). The last part of the obverse and the reverse describe the procession of !star from the Esgal-temple to the akftu-temple, and resembles the Anu-procession described in KAR 132. TU 41 contains a ritual for days 16 and 17 of an unknown month, describing the good-functioning of the temple ceremony (saliim b'iti) and the vigil (bajjatu)held during 36 Which is indicated, for example, by TU 38, where a list of offerings and ceremonies is given which are twritten down in (the tablets of) the rites for the whole year' (rev. 38). See also TU 39-40, which contains the rites for the seventh month Tasntu, after which the colophon refers to the next tablet containing the rites of the eighth month Arabsamna (TU 39, rev. 25 f.). Texts which describe ritual proceedings for the whole year on one single tablet are unknown as far as the Hellenistic period is concerned, but we do have LKU, no. 51, dated to the late Neo-Babylonian or early Achaernenid period, listing ceremonies for Belet-sa-Uruk, Ul?ur-amassu and Aska'itu for all twelve months of the year. For the date see A. Falkenstein, LKU, 1. the night in the Res-temple. Pongratz-Leisten37 has suggested that this ritual perhaps was performed during the tenth month Tebetu, because TU 38 records offerings to the planets which have to be performed on top of the temple tower on the sixteenth of'febetu,38 which can be connected with TU 41, since there offerings are brought to the planets on the sixteenth day.39 Because part of the ritual is performed by a priest addressed in the second person, TU 41 probably does not belong to the large series of temple rituals covering the whole year.40 The temple ritual text W 18728, published by Falkenstein,41 was probably written in the Hellenistic period and deals with clothing instructions for different persons, including several priests and the king.42 The Hellenistic text W 18828, also published by Falkenstein,43 contains ritual instructions for work in the templeá workshop (bit mummi) with a hymn to Samas. Unfortunately only three lines of the ritual are partly preserved. The fragment Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 14_ is perhaps also a ritual. The Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts and probably also TU 38-43 come from one or more locations within the Res-temple and appear to belong to the corpus of at least one exorcist (iisipu): TU 38 and TU 39-40 were written by the exorcist Samas-etir, son of Ina-qibit-Anu, son of Sibqat-Anu, decendant of the asipu-family Ekur-zakir. The colophon of TU 38 states that the exorcist Kidin-Anu, descendant of Ekur-zakir, copied the text in Elam and brought it back with him to Uruk. The owner of TU 39-40 is also an exorcist, although not from the Ekur-zakir family: Anu-uballit, son ofNidintu-Anu, son oflna-qibit-Anu, descendant of ijunzfi. For TU 41-43 no colophons are preserved. ,. The colophon of BRM 4, 7 indicates that the text was written by Anu-balassu-iqbi, son of the ownerofthe tablet, the exorcist Anu-aba-usabsi, son ofKidin-Anu, descendant of Ekur-zakir. It also informs us that the scribe 'has written (the tablet) for his (own) instruction, his long days, his well-being and the permanence of his position and set (it) up in Uruk and in the Res-temple, the temple of his lordship' (rev. 45-47), indicating perhaps that 'he made two copies, one for his private library at home and one which was kept in the temple, where it was available to the public cult. Furthermore, he wrote the text for himself, which shows that the text was part of his private archive. We have no other prosopographical information on Anu-balassu-iqbi, but his father, Anu-aba-usabsi, is also attested as the owner of the chronicle text SpTU 1, no. 2 (dated 61 S.E.), found in the living quarters Ue XVIII,44 which indicates that Anu-aba-usabsi had a private archive in his home in the Ue XVIII area, like the better known exorcists Anu-ik~ur, lqisa, and Nidintu-Anu.BRM 4, 7 and the other texts which name Anu-aba-usabsi as the owner .or scribe4S may have come from this library as well, but it is equally possible that some 37 ina sulmi irub, 45. 38 Rev. 32-34. 39 Obv. 22-28. ,co See II.8.6. 41 UVB 15 (1959), 40-44. 42 A ritual text of the late Neo-Babylonian or early Achaemenid period is LKU, no. 48, containing a ritual for the king. For the date see A. Falkenstein, LKU, I. 43 UVB 15 (1959), 36-40. 44 Although not on the location where some of the the Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2-texts were found (Ue XVill 1), see J. Oelsner, Materialien, 143. See also n. 13 above. 45 See my introduction to BRM 4, 7, in the Appendix. I. Introduction of these texts were kept in the Res-temple. Note that two of the Anu-al}a-ufabsi-tablets, TU 19 and W 18828 both probably come from the Res-area, although the exact location remains uncertain. W 18728 was found together with W 18828 in the Res-temple. The contents of KAR 132 suggests that it belongs to the temple ritual series similar to TU 38--43, but the tablet comes from illicit digging and the colophon is lost. A few texts which deal with the eclipse of the moon ritual perhaps also belong to this group. In BRM 4, 6 and BM 13470146 the eclipse of the moon ritual is described extensively. Thompson, CLBT, pl. I, contains some kind of (lunar eclipse?) ritual, and furthermore a lunar eclipse myth; col.Bis partly duplicated by the Uruk: text BRM 4, 6,47 which makes it likely that the former was also written in Uruk:. 48 This is confirmed by col. A, 27 where the Res-temple, and the Enamenna, the cella of Anu in the Res-temple, are mentioned. Although no colophons have been preserved which attribute these texts to the corpus of the iisipu,49 we know that the exorcist plays an important role in the eclipse ritual. A second group of temple rituals belongs to the corpus of the lamentation priest (kalu). They do not belong to the large series of temple ritual texts, but are rituals for special occasions. Several texts deal with the kettledrum (lilissu), most important of which is TU 44.50 Partial duplicates are Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, no. 7, and perhaps also the fragment no. 9. Here we should also mention Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 6, a bilingual hand-raising prayer (suillakku) for the consecration of the bull, whose hide is used to cover the kettledrum. 51 The building rituals also belong to the corpus of the lamentation priest. TU 45 and TU 46 are in many ways very similar, but there are also important differences between them.52 Other duplicates are Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, and no. 11. The texts belonging to this second group probably all come from the Res-temple area Le XVI 3. The colophons indicate that most of the texts belong to the archive of 46 The latter was published by D. Brown and the present author in: BM 134701 "" 1965-10-14,1 and the Hellenistic period eclipse ritual from Uruk, RA 91 (1997), 147-166. 47 CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 1-14 // BRM 4, 6, obv. 5-11. 48 Cf. W.G. Lambert, JCS 16 (1962), 74b. The fact that the tablet was written in Uruk, does not necessarily mean that J. Oelsner, Materialien, 207-8, was wrong in assuming that the tablet was probably found in Babylon. 49 Note however that Thompson, CLBT, pl. I, col. B, 29 perhaps refers to 'the office of the exorcist' (a-si-lJ,u-ti(?)]). See the Appendix. 50 The text is partly a duplicate of the Neo-Assyrian text KAR 60. s1 Important for our understanding of the kettledrum ritual is the Neo-Assyrian text KAR 50, which is apparently a shortened version of the ritual. On the obverse we find a bilingual incantation for 1the choice bull, the creation of the great gods'. The reverse describes the actual ritual. Part of the text is duplicated by K 6060 (BBR2, no. 56) + K 10820 (see Plate II). Also relevant is the Neo-Assyrian text IV RZ, 23, no. l + K 9421 (for the latter see Plate lll); here several recitations, known from other kettledrum ritual texts, are presented in full. s2 TU46 is also partially duplicated by the Late Babylonian Uruk text Sp TU 4, no. 141. The Late Babylonian text F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no. 12 from Babylon is partially a duplicate of these texts. As SpTU 4, no. 141 it contains the beginning of the recitation Enuma Anu ibnu same,only referred to by its incipit is the Uruk version TU 46. Another part of this recitation is attested in the unpublished Rm 101 (see Plate IV and my comments on I. 24ff. ofF.H. Weissbach, Misc., no.12, in the Appendix). 1.2.The texts the lamentation priest Anu-belsunu, son ofNidintu-Anu, descendant of the kalu-family Sin-leqe-unnini.53 The owner of the tablet TU 44 is the chief singer of dirges (galamiibu) Anu-aba-ittannu, son ofRibat-Anu; we know from a private contract that he was also a descendant of Sin-leqe-unnini.54 Babylon Unfortunately, because most of the texts from Babylon come from illicit excavations, we are unable to establish where the texts discussed here were originally kept. Although it is quite possible that many of the Hellenistic temple ritual texts, and also administrative documents e.g. CT 49, constitute remnants of the (not yet found) Esagila archive, we must for now take as our starting point that for the origin of the texts both temple archives as private archives are possible.ss á Originally, as in Uruk also in Babylon .a series of temple ritual texts which covered the whole year must have existed, but only fragments of this have survived.56 Important evidence for such a series is the ritual átext DT 15 +, published by Thureau-Dangin in RAcc., 127ff. The surviving fragments belong to two tablets which are identified as tablet 22 and 23 of the ritual series, as is specifically stated.57 The text refers to the public cult of Marduk, here called Bel. It describes part of the New Year festival of the first month Nisannu, and concentrates especially on the prayers which accompanied the cuftic activity. Unfortunately the fragments cover only day 2 to 5, and even these are not complete. In his unpublished dissertation Cagirgan discussed a short fragment from his private collection, referring to the first day of the New Year festiva1,ss and furthermore, he used the unpublished text BM 32654 + 38193 ('extract from a mythological text') for the restoration of I. 69-79 of the New Year ritual.59 Finally, the unpublished text BM 32485 (published here, see Plate I) is a fragment belonging to DT 109; the reverse contains part of the last lines of the ritual of day 5. The text on the obverse is almost entirely lost. More information on (perhaps) the first month Nisannu comes from BM 41577, a ritual text from the Hellenistic period, which is published by A.R. George.60 The text deals with a visit of Marduk to the cella of Bel and Beltrja in Esagila, probably during day 6 or 7 of the New Year festival, as George suggests.61 Another possibly Hellenistic fragment, BM 47902 +, deals with events taking place in the akftu-temple Bft ikribi during the New Year festival ofNisannu.62 ¥ S3 See the introductions of these texts, in the Appendix. 54 See my introduction of TU 44, in the Appendix.

Introduction For the month Simanu we are almost solely dependant on BM 32656, a temple ritual fragment probably from the Hellenistic period, which is published by A.R. George.63 The rituals in this texts do not deal with the cult of Marduk or his son Nabu, but with the cult of !star of Babylon in the temple Eturkalamma, which must have had its own ritual series. Until recently our most important source for the month Kis1Imu was the calendar text SBH VII// BRM 4, 25. Important new evidence for the month Kis1Imu is now available from a large Esagila-ritual text dealing specifically with this month, BM 32206 +.64The text, part of the ritual series of Babylon, describes city ceremonies in Babylon on days 3 and 4 of the month Kis1Imu and gives us new evidence for cultic activities in this month. The procession to the akftu-temple outside Babylon is esspecially important.65 The text also contains references to the so-called palm festival. 66 The date of the texts In many cases the text contains a colophon with the name of the writer and/or the owner, the place where the tablet was written, and a date. 67 Sometimes, when the date is lost or missing, prosopographical information can also help us in dating the text. 68 Other texts have to be dated on palaeographical, grammatical and linguistic grounds, e.g. the signs lu and ku written without the top horizontal wedge, the use of the aleph-sign ' on the end of words, or the prefix ta-and tu-for the third p. fem. sing. verb (an example of Aramaic influence).69 A very small script is also an important indication for a late date. Sometimes the archaeological history of a tablet i.e. the place where, and stratum in which, it was found can help us. Nevertheless, we are not always able to date a text more specifically then 'Late Babylonian' (i.e. from the Achaemenid or Hellenistic period). 63 Studies W.G.

important information on the palm festival, is published by A.R. George, Studies W.G. Lambert, no. 3,280 ff. 
The unpublished temple ritual fragment BM 54901 (see II.8.2) probably also refers to this festival. 
For the month Sablitu we do not have temple rituals which can be dated to the Hellenistic period. We do have a fragment which was published by WG. Lambert in OECT 11, no. 47, and more information on this month is now available from BM 32516 II 41239 (the latter was published by A.R. George, BIT, no. 57). This text is published by A.R. George, Studies W.G. Lambert, no. 4, 289 ff. Other fragments relating to temple rituals in Babylon are VS24, 108 (+) 109II 110(B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina Iulmi 'frub, nos. 10-11, 236--39) and K 3446 + (see now W.G. Lambert, RA 91 [1997], 56--62), possibly referring to the New Year festival in Nisannu; see also the smaller fragments CT 51, 94-97, 99-102, 104, and A.R. George, B1T, nos. 40-45. 67 See for example the rituals BRM 4, 7, which is dated 61 S.E. (251/0 B.C.), W 18828, dated 62 S.E. (250149 B.C.), TU 46, dated 81 S.E. (231/0 B.C.), Bagh. Mitt.

See also the explanatory,text BM 34035 (Sp I 131), dated 111 A.E i.e. 175(!) S.E. i.e. 137/6 B.C. (see J. Oelsner,Materialien,227). 
68 See for example the introductions of the ritual texts TU 38, TU 39-40, TU 44, and TU 45 and 46, in the 
Appendix. 
69 See W. von Soden, GAG,¤ 193. 
We know that at least in some cases the texts are copied in the Hellenistic period from older originals, as is specifically stated for example in the colophons of TU 38, TU 39-40, BRM 4, 7, TU 44, and W 18828. For this reason we must assume that many if not all of our texts describe older rituals, going back several centuries. When were these older rituals written? For Uruk it is clear that the texts appear to have been adjusted to the Late Babylonian situation: the gods mentioned in the texts belong to the Anu-pantheon of the Late Babylonian period, and not to the !star-pantheon of the Neo-Babylonian period. Also the topography of Uruk as manifested in the texts is clearly Late Babylonian: in the texts, the Res-and Esgal-temples, and not the Eanna-temple complex, are the dominating sanctuaries of the city. Consequently most of our texts are probably copies of older rituals written at the latest during the fifth ct;ntury.70 However, it is possible that these texts are adaptations of even older rituals going back to the Neo-Babylonian period. We do not know much about these older rituals, but one example of such a document has been presen:ed which gives us some inside information on the cult in Uruk before the Anu-panth_eon was introduced. This text, LKU no. 51, was probably written during the Late Neo-Babylonian or early Achaemenid period. 71 It appears to be a list of offerings, ceremonies and processions for the whole year, but also of the days, on which the lamentation priest (ka/u)had to perform his cultic duties. The twelve months of the year are discussed, but the first two months, and part of the third are lost. The goddesses Belet-sa-Uruk (= !star), U~ur-amassu and Aska'itu in the Eanna-temple are the main protagonists. The text is in many ways similar to the temple ritual texts from Hellenistic Uruk, especially TU 42 +, in which !star also plays an important part.72 The Babylon ritual DT 15 + (RAcc., 127ff.) may also be an adaptation of an older ritual going back to the Neo-Babylonian period. Thureau-Dangin assumed that the text was written during the Hellenistic period.73 Zimmern concluded that 'dieses Neujahrs.festritual, wenigstens in seinem jetzigen Wortlaut, nicht etwa, wie mancher sonstige spate Text, eine sklavische Kopie aus alterer Zeit ist, sondem vielmehr auf der Grund.lage alterer Vorlagen eine freie Konzeption des Neujahrsfestrituals fiirdie Priesterschaft des Esagil-Tempels in Babylon aus der spatesten, seleukidisch-parthischen, Periode darstellt' .74 Finally, the important Late Babylonian Esagila-ritual concerned with the month Kislimu, BM 32206 +, is possibly also of Hellenistic date, but refers back to older originals, as Lambert suggested. 75 70 See also I.3. 71 See above. 12 See A. Falkenstein,LKU, 2. For TU 42 +, see 11.8.5. 73 RAcc., I. 14 ZA 34 (1922), 192. 1s JCS43--4S (1991-93), 89-90. I. Introduction 1.3. The cult Some general observations According to Mesopotamian theology the @ds are the creators of the world and of humans; the latter had to serve the gods in return for individual and communal prosperity and well-beil_!g. This service involved pro"'.~~~Il:g everything the gods needed to lead a 
comfortable existence, and was formalized in ~~~e!._!? av_oi-9,_~LI_Il!~aj<:e~
or negligence, '!hi~~--~9\!lc_Lh!!V:~-~~~ ~!s~~ous consequences fo~~~ p__eoe!e and their cities. This formalized service for the gods is ~e 2:,~lt. In general, one could define a cult as a form_J...~_m:_actice ,in which the worshipping of a divinity takes place. In a cult communication with the divine is expressed in certain wor~~! formulas, ~es and actions. One usually distinguishes between, first, a more individual worshipping, and secondly, a common worshipping, the official cult, which was performed by a community; the cult is then expressed in feasts and gatheri~ Cul tic acts such as offerings, purifications, cultic meals, prayers, incantations and processions, are often performed in or near sacred places like temples. The Mes.opotamians envisaged the cult in an ~thropomorphic way: although the gods were thought to reside in heaven and the und~r;world, in every Mesopotamian city many gods also lived in their own temples. Furthermore, each city also had its own main go'd; a cj!Y_Q_atro11 tel!!Iili:, where he or shewas-represented whq_wi_de.4.i_~Jl}~-~!li!:Jr ~an anthro~~'?rphi~_ st_a~. The statues were considered to be manifestations of the gods on earth; rather than being mere images they were regarded as extensions of the personality of the-gods. The statues were identified with the gods in question and were considered to be likeliving beings, ~l!~ust like humans, had to eat, sleep, wake and be dressed, and were therefore in the center of ceremonies and presented with regular and special offeringsr The statu~'served as the focal point for sacrificial activities'. 76 The cultic proceeafngs were probably based on Babylonian court practices. Like a king living with his family and servants in the palace, in the temple the main god of the city lived with other gods who acted as his family and servants. Under the guidance of priests the inhabitants of the city were responsible for the worship and fee~ing of fut?gods throughout the year. However, the temple was not a place were everyone came together to worship the god. Only certain priests and other temple personnel, who were able to perform the often elaborate ceremonies and rituals, and on occasion, for example during the New Year festival, the king or a high official of the city, had access to the temple. There is much written evidence concerning the official temple cult, especially in the ritual texts. Of the private popular religion not much is known. 77 76 A.L. Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia, 185.

Continuity and Change in the forms of Religious Life, SHCANE VII, Leiden, New York, Koln, 1996; id., in: K.R. Veenhof(ed.), Houses and Households in The temple was not only a religious centre. Although it was considered to be the house of the god (and as such all the temple property was the property of the main god of the temple) it was also an economic ~enter, raising taxes (tithes), owning land, slaves and livestock, and taking part in trade and money-lending. In return the temple provided a large part of the income of citizens who performed certain duties in connection with the temple, either by distributing part of the temple income or by paying wages. Also leasing temple land to tenants was important. The temple was, together with the palace, to a large extent in charge of the land and the economic activities.78 A clear definition of the cult is never presented in texts from Mesopotamia. However, the colophon of the ritual text TU 38 gives us an idea of how the priesthood of Hellenistic Uruk envisaged the cult to be (rev. 44-50): ' 44Wax-table (containing) the rites for the Anu-worship, the pure sulu/Jbu-purificationrites, the ritual regulations of kingship, including(?) the divine su/ubbu-purification rites of the Re¤-temple, the Esgal-temple, 451:he Eanna-temple and the (other) temples of Tiranna, the ritual activities of the exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers and the craftsmen, 46all of them, who are subservient to the ... , not to mention all that concerns the apprentices, in accordance with the contents of the tablets, 47which Nabopolassar, king of the Sealand, carried off(salalu) from Uruk. And at that time(?) Ki_din-Anu from Uruk, 48the exorcist of Anu and Antu, descendant of Ekur-zakir, the high priest of the Re¤-temple, 49saw 48these tablets in the land of Elam and during the reign of Seleucus and Antiochus, the kings, SOhe copied and brought (them) to Uruk\ Here, clearly, an attempt is being made to give a complete description of the cult in Uruk. The text first mentions the rites for the main deity Anu, followed by the purification rites. Then it refers to the duties of the king in the cult. The purification rites of all the , temples of Uruk are recorded, after which those who are responsible for performing the cult in these temples are enumerated. Finally, it gives an explanation for the origin of the cult instructions. The main temples and their gods Where was the official cult practised?79 In Babylon the ancient Esagila-temple complex was still the most important cultic building of the city in the Hellenistic period, constituting the centre of the Bel-Marduk-cult.BO The pantheon of Babylon remained Ancient Mesopotamia, 40e RAI Leiden 1993, Leiden, Istanbul, 1996, 69-78.

unchanged in the Hellenistic period, as becomes clear not only from the ritual texts and other non-cultic sources, but also from a large group of cult songs;81 although most of these texts are probably not Hellenistic compositions but copies of older originals, we know that these texts were still used for the cult of the old gods, because not only were many of these texts copied in Hellenistic Babylon, but their colophons indicate that these copies were used 'for singing' (ana zamarz), which can only mean that they were used in the cult. s2 The Esagila-temple remained in use at least until the first century A.O. as we know 1 from astronomical texts, the latest of which is dated to 75 A.D.83The astronomical diaries mention the assembly (ki.nistu)and administrator (satammu) of Esagila in 78 B.C.84Other temples are attested in the archive of a temple official called Rabimesu (94-92 B.C.)85: Eturkalamma, the temple oflstar ofBabylon,&6 Esabad, the temple of Gula in Babylon,87 and furthermore the temples of Zababa and Ninlil,&& Nabu-sa-bare,&9 Mada.nu and the akftu-temple.90 In Uruk an important change came about during the Late Babylonian period.

Falkenstein interpreted this colophon as propaganda from the Urukaean priesthood designed to legitimate the Late Babylonian Anu-cult.96 We know that this process of ch~ge from !star-to Anu.predominance took place over a longer period of time, and ~tan invention of the priests of Hellenistic Uruk. Evidence from the Late Babylonian period has confirmed this: based on onomastic evidence Beaulieu concluded that probably between 521, the first regnal year of Darius I, and 424, the first regnal year of Darius II, Anu took over from Istar.97 After the conquest of the Neo-Babylonian empire by .Cyrus-in 539-the liegemony of the national god and the god of the capital, ~~~e_!~. ~.

99 A. Falkenstein (Topographie,8) already noted that a temple called Resis indirectly attested in texts from 
the Neo-Babylonian period: texts belonging to the Eanna-archive mention the goddess Belet-sa-Res. Note, 
however, that this goddess also appears in the annals of Sennacherib, cf. D.D. Luckenbill, 0/P 2, p. 87, 31-33, 
where several deities dwelling in Uruk are mentioned, among which (in 31) is Belet-sa-Res (sare1-e-s1). 
100 Texts from Eanni become rare after the second regnal year of Darius I (520/19 B.C.), which has led 
some scholars to assume that Eanna was destroyed by Darius I. However, as M. Dandamayev has shown 
(AMI 25 [ 1992], 169-72), documentary ~idence from the Late Achaemenid period clearly undermines this 
hypothesis. 
101 A quitclaim written during the reign of Mithridates II (K. Kessler, Bagh. Mitt. 15 [1984], 273-81, dated 
108 B.C.) refers to the Res-temple, the Esgal-temple and the other temples ofUruk and relates to the sale 
of prebend shares, which shows that temple service was still taking place. Cf. S. Sherwin-White, A. Kuhrt, 
From Samarkhand to Sardis, 155. In the astronomical diaries from Babylon Uruk is mentioned as late as 83

I. Introduction The officials Who were responsible for the rituals and ceremonies in the temples?I0 2 In the Babylonian language there is no general word for 'priest'. There are officials whose duties are strictly confined to (religious) tasks in the temple, and who are considered to be initiates, i.e. who belong to a group of persons possessing secret knowledge, which may not be shared with outsiders. See for example the following warning in the Uruk kettledrum ritual TU .44, III, 29-30: ' 29Tiris ritual procedure, which you perform, only the novice (tarbutu) Jomay see (it); an outsider, someone who is not responsible for the rites (la miir be/ par[!i), may not see (it)' _103 McEwan has discussed all the 'priests' known from the Hellenástic period.1 04 Most ~~n?_~l:~~ ~-!~~ts ~01!1.~~~l_enistic B~~r~~ais the exorcist (as.iEY.))osWe know that he :elayed a_ maJor _pmin !h,e teI_!!Q}e rituals _and.

Furthermore there are special priests, who were responsible for performing the recitations, such as the singer (niiru), the lamentation priests (ka/u) and the chief singer 102 In contrast to Egypt and Israel the administration of the temples in Babylonia was performed by civil servants who had no priestly duties. These civil servants were discussed by G.J.P. McEwan, FAQS 4, 25 ff_ and R.J. van der Spek, Grondbezit in het Seleucidische rijk, 57ff. (Babylon) and 79ff. (Uruk) (an English sununary in: A. Kuhrt, S. Sherwin-White (ed_), Hellenism in the East, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1987, 57-74). Many references to Babylonian cultic personnel are also to be found in R.A. Henshaw, Female aánd Male. 103 Cf_G.J.P. McEwan, FAQS 4, 10. For this secret knowledge see P.-A. Beaulieu, ZA 82 (1992), 98ff. 104 FAQS 4, 7 ff. ( chapter I), with text references (see however the review articles)_ Among the texts published after McEwan's study, the Kislimu ritual BM 32206 + is especially important for its additional information on priests and other temple personnel. Not attested elsewhere arethe DUMU.NiG.LA.LA, possibly to be read as mar !aliiti (see G. C:agirgan, W.G. Lambert, JCS 43-45 [1991-93], 90--1), and, although very uncertain, the ba{{aru (ib., JOI). 105 For the occasional reading 11!MAS.MAS see= maimassu instead of asipu in the Late Babylonian period my comment on TU 38, rev. 45, in the Appendix. 106 He is mentioned together with the lamentation priest, the singer and the craftsmen (in the colophon of TU 38, rev. 45). He is also mentioned together with the lamentation priest and the singer in the Uruk New Year festival (TU 39, obv. 35; rev. 19) and he takes part in procession during this festival (TU 39, obv. 27, with a temple enterer, TU 40, rev 6, 9, with the king; BRM 4, 7, passim, with the high priest, the temple enterer and the brewers), and recites incantations (BRM 4, 7, passim). He also takes part in the festival of !star (TU 42 +, rev.30'). During the night vigil festivities he consecrates the Scepter, takes part in a procession with the torch together with the head temple enterer, the lamentation priests and the singers, and extinguishes the torch (TU 41, obv. 4, 33, rev. 19). He recites incantations during the eclipse of the moon ritual (BRM 4, 6, obv. 35 f.). Finally, he has a minor role in the kettledrum ritual and the building ritual, see 11.5.3 and II.6.3. 107 The exorcist consecrates the temple (RAcc., 140, 340ff.) and recites incantations (RAcc., 141,355). 108 See I.2. of dirges (galamiibu I kalamabbu ).109 The kettledrum ritual and the building ritual 110 belong to the text corpus of the lamentation priest (kalutu).111 The leading priest in th~ temple is the&t,u rabu'high pries~; 112 he is especially well.known from ritual texts. Not mentioned by McEwan is the enu:Prie_st.113 Referred to only rarely intexts from Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon are the sangu~ma!Jbu and sulubbu.114 'fhe same is true for the cultic performers as_sinn~ kur.g_C!!J:U 5 Thean!J.!!..1J1Jahlu~fu:..lldiviner performing extispicy (baru) is not well attested in the Hellenistic period, which however is not a result of Greek influence, but must be explained by the fact that in the /:. Hellenistic period divination was to a large extent replaced by astrologx, as ~c~w_~ suggested.116 This is confirmed by the fact that most of the texts in which the diviner is ~tioned are in all probability Hellenistic copies of older originals. Finally, the texts often mention the erib bfti 'temple enterer', i.e. a person who is allowed to enter the restricted areas of the temple.117As Bongenaará convincingly argued, 'erib biti is not a general word, class, position or honorific title, but has just o~e meaning: "the owner of an erib bitutu prebend"' .118 Anyone who held certain officesá or had to perform certain duties in the temple owned an erib bitutu prebend. It is therefore no surprise to find that 'priests', and also those experts and craftsmen who were needed inside the temple to perform their duties, such as the goldsmith (kutimmu), the carpenter (naggiiru), the jeweller (kabsarru), the seal-cutter (purku!lu),and the craftsman (gurgurru),were called erib biti. The fact that a person designated as cook/baker (nul}atimmu),brewer (siriisu),oil processor (~iilJitu),butcher (fiibibu),or miller (ararru)is sometimes also called erib biti, does not contradict Bongenaar's theory. Obviously a cook or butcher only delivered his goods and his work did not require admission into the restricted parts of the temple, but this does not mean that he did not hold other offices or perform other tasks which did make it necessary for him to enter the temple. 119 The fact that the erib biti is sometimes 109 kalii was usually written h!QALA, but in the astronomical diaries 16LAGAR, cf. W. Horowitz, RA 8S (1991), 75, n. 4 with literature. For the lamentation priest see (apart from G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 11 ff.) M.K.Schretter,Emesal-Studien,Innsbruck, 1990, 135, J.A. Black, Eme-sal Cult Songs and Prayers, and R.A. Henshaw,Female and Male, 88-96. McEwan collected most of the textual references, but see also the Uruk text W 18728, obv. 1 O'and 12', which mentions the consecrated ('shaven') lamentation priest 06GALA gul-lu-bu),probably belonging to the regular personnel of the temple, and the unconsecrated lamentation priest 06GALAla gul-lu-bu).See 11.S. l 110 See II.5 and 11.6. 111 See 1.2. 112 For the reading auu rabii instead of sesgalluin texts from the Hellenistic period, see my-comments on TU 38, rev. 48, in the Appendix. 113 TU 42 +, obv. 16 (but see my comments on this line in the Appendix);KAR 132, III, 15. 114 There is no evidence that the gerseqqii,usually translated tattendant', or the ~U.BAR.RA ( cf. G.J.P.McE.wan,FAOS4, 8 and 11) had any priestly duties. Cf. J.A. Brinkman, JCS 35 (1983), 233. 115 For the assinnu and kurgarn1and their participation in the so-called Divine Love Lyrics during the Arsacid period, as suggested by Ph.M. Hibbert, WdO 15 (1984), 93-95, see 11.8.S. 116 FAOS4, 15. 117 See G. Frame, ZA 81 (1991), 42 and A.C.V.M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebabbar temple at Sippar, l46f., with more references. 118 lb., 149. 119 A good example is Marduk-Auma-iddin, calledanerib bfti ofEsabad in CT 49, 161, obv. 6-7 (18-Vl-93 B.C.), and referred to as a baker in AB 245 (G.J.P. McEwan,Jraq 43 [1981], 136ff.), obv. 6 (18-VI-93 B.C.); cf. R.J. van der Spek, BiOr 52 (1985), S47-8. These texts belong to the archive of the official Rabimesu. Another text from this archive ( CT 49, 156, dated I O-ll-93 B.C.) refers to theerib bitutu, a prebendary office I. Introduction mentioned together with other priests or craftsmen is not surprising either, because in these cases the erib bftis are always mentioned as being the last in line, and should be interpreted as 'the (other) erib bftis'. This is confirmed by the ritual text BRM 4, 7, which describes a procession of Anu from the Res-temple to the akftu-temple. After Anu has left the cella Enamenna and has arrived at the Grand Gate, the high priest (abu rabu), the exorcists, the ( other) erib bftis, and the brewers recite a prayer. This is repeated during the different stages of the procession until they reach the akftu-temple.120 Because Anu. has left the restricted temple area, the brewers, mentioned after the erib bftis because they are not allowed to enter the temple, can join in as bearers of the carrying pole (gistallu). As we saw, the colophon of TU 38 presents us with a list of priests and craftsmen who perform cul tic proceedings in the temples: it mentions the ritual activities of theá exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers and the craftsmen (DUMU.MES um.man-nu).121Together with the high priest (not mentioned in the colophon), these are the persons who are most often mentioned in the temple ritual texts, and who are responsible for performing the ceremonies and rituals. However, there is one other person, who also takes part in cultic activities on certain occasions: the king. The king We have many references to the king in the temple ritual texts. His tasks in the public cult ( called the sakke sarrutu the 'ritual regulations of kingship') are referred to in the description of the Uruk cult in the colophon of TU 38.122The additional offerings of the king (tardft sarn), mentioned in a list of offerings and ceremonies in TU 38 form part of these ritual regulations.123 Furthermore the king takes part in the New Year festivals in Uruk and Babylon,124 participates in the special festival for Istar of Uruk,125 recites ersem.fobungu-prayersin the Uruk building ritual,126 and appears in the last part of the ¥ lunar eclipse ritual in Uruk.127 The question is whether in the Hellenistic period the Macedonian kings participated in the cult activities in the same manner as did the Babylonian and Achaemenid kings in the previous periods. The temple ritual texts do not give us any information on this, but non-cultic sources, especially chronicles, building inscriptions and the astronomical diaries suggest that this is the case, and for a good reason too. As Sherwin-White and Kohrt stated: 'in Babylonia ( ... ) the Seleucid kings present a coherent picture of rulers who are no foreign enemy but constitute a legitimate and just dynasty, attuned to local gods and actively participating in cults. Here, the tradition of Babylonian kingship gave of the temple enterer in the Day One temple i.e. the akftu-templein Arsacid Babylon, which shows that the, cult was still practiced in the first century B.C. The temple enterer is also mentioned in the Rabimesu-text K. Kessler, in FestschriftJ. Oelsner,no. 9 (94/3 B.C.).

l.3. The cult king and subject a framework to operate in. ( ... ) The Seleucid kings seem effectively to have taken on, and could be felt to have fulfilled, some aspects of their Achaemenid and Babylonian inheritance'_ 12s The involvement of the Macedonian kings with the Babylonian temples has been described by Van der Spek 129: ~lexander started to restore Esagila in Babylon and 1-!i¤. successors also undertook building renovations on the temples ofUruk and Babylq_v.Bo .Aswtll be Illustrated in the following chapters, many references in the astronomical diaries indicate the active participation of the Macedonian king, or of high officials acting as his representatives, in the official cult in the temples, performing offerings and ceremonies or taking part in the New Year festival. The reason for this participation is religious (the king is representative of the people, honoring the gods and seeking support, advice and protection from danger from the gods for himself and his subjects), political (legitimation of his position, seeking support and goodwill from his people), and economic (using the wealth of the temples to provide an income for himself and to subsidize military campaigns). Van der Spek des<;ribes the role of the king as the benefactor of the temples, who hopes to find moral arid financial support for his political and military plans, but also as the robber of temple funds in times of crisis. On religious matters however the temples were usually left in peace. We do find in the astronomical diaries many references to special rituals which were held for one or more gods and 'for the life of' the king and his royal family. These were not necessarily imposed on the temples by the king, but may have developed spontaneously in the cities of the Seleucid empire, including Babylonia. The rituals for the king are usually referred to as ruler cults and are discussed elsewhere. 131 Cult terminology In the texts from Mesopotamia we find a wide range of general terms referring to the cult and to its different elements, e.g. 'ceremony (rite), ritual, ritual procedure/activity, festival' etc. Unfortunately most of these terms apparently have a general meaning: clear definitions are not given and the context often does not give us enough clues to distinguish one term from another. 132 We will list these terms here and discuss their relevance for the Hellenistic period. A general word, attested from the Old Babylonian period on, is par:1u'rite, cult', written syllabically but also with the Sumerograms GARZA and ME. The former originally stood for 'cult practice, rite', and ME for 'divine power, divine order', two different meanings which, according to Landsberger, assimilated into the Akkadian par~u.133We 121 From Samarkhand to Sardis, 38-9.

Par~, used as a more general reference to the entire cult, is attested in a passage from TU 38, where after the enumeration of several offerings and ceremonies the text states that these are 'written down in (the tablets of) the rites for the whole year' (sa ina GARZAsa kal MU.AN.NAsaf-ri).134Here the rites of the divine marriage (GARZA.GARZA !Ja-sa-du)are also mentioned, 135and the colophon of this text begins with the rites for the Anu-worship (GARZA dLX-u-tu).136 The term par~u is also used in texts describing the New Year festivals from Uruk137 and Babylon, 138 and in a kettledrum ritual text from Uruk, referring to someone who is not responsible for the rites.139 In this ritual we also find par~u used in combination withkidudu 'ritual' 140: the bull is taken to be used for the rites and rituals (a-na par-# u K.I.DU.DU-de-e).141We also have one reference in an eclipse of the moon(?) ritual, but the context is diffi.cult.142 Finallypar~u is (rarely) recorded in the astronomical diaries from Babylon.143 nepesu 'ritual, ritual procedure', often used in-the plural (nepesii),is especially well.known from the Neo-Assyrian period on, and is usually written syllabically. It is also mentioned in Hellenistic ritual texts.IÇ Many times it is attested in the phrase ne-pe-si sa sunhi.GALA'(This is) the ritual procedure of the lamentation priest', used to identify the ritual or a recitation, perfonned during a ritual, as belonging to the text corpus of the lamentation priest (kalutu).145Furthermore, nepesu is known from the kettledrum ritual (here with the exceptional writing DfM.DIM.MA),146 the building ritual,147and the eclipse of the moon ritual.148 In a Hellenistic temple ritual fragment dealing with 134 TU 38, rev.38. 135 TU 38, obv.37; rev.37; see also TU 39, obv. 4 (par~i sa ba-sa-du).

In the Hellenistic ritual texts we have a few examples from the kettledrum ritual.152 In an astronomical diary it is mentioned together with a Greek festival called puppe.153 The cognate epustu, written DU.DU.BI, 'the pertinent (lit. its) ritual', i.e the ritual which accompanies the recited incantation or prayer, is not attested in Hellenistic ritual texts. 154 Several other terms for cult, rite, service, festival etc. are known, which are, however, seldom attested or not at all in: Hellenistic ritual texts. One of these terms is sakku 'ritual regulations' (plur. tantum),155 known from the Old Babylonian period, but also attested in texts from the first millennium B.C. In the Hellenistic ritual texts it is attested only once, in the colophon of TU 38 together with several other rites, referring to the ritual regulations ofkingship.1 56 Another rarely used word is alaktu (a/katu) '(ritual) activities', attested from the Old Akkadian period on. Like sakku it is only known in the Hellenistic ritual texts from the colophon of TU 38, referring to the ritual activities of the exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers and the craftsmen. 157 Although the very common term dullu 'ritual, divine service, cult' is well-known from the áHellenistic period, for example in legal documents,158 it is not attested in rituals.159 Similar in meaning is sipru 'work, service'; only two examples from the Hellenistic ritual corpus are attested.160 Pelludu 'cult' is not known from Hellenistic ritual texts, but it is attested in a calendar text from Babylon.161 Other terms like mesu(plur. tantum), 'cults, cultic rites, rituals', and kikkittu'ritual act' are not known from Hellenistic ritual texts. niitu is onJy attested in Neo-Assyrian rituals.162 149 BM 32656 (A.R.

A general term for 'festival' is isinnu, a word which goes back to the Old Babylonian period, and can refer both to a religious and a secular festival. Although a general use of isinnu is also known, more often it concerns a special festival identified by the name of a god, a temple or a month.163 A special case is the festival of the New Year (isinnu akftu),164In the Hellenistic period isinnu is not attested in ritual texts. However, we have two occurrences in other texts, both referring to special festivals. First, in the ritual calendar SBH VIII, II, 7; here isinnu probably refers to the akftu-festival of the first month Nisannu in Babylon,165 The second reference is recorded in an Arsacid administrative text from Babylon, AB 248,166 which refers to day 25 of Simanu on which a temple festival ofEsabad is celebrated.J67 Finally we should mention nigutu 'music, festival', not known from Hellenistic ritual texts, but attested in the chronicle texts.168From the astronomical diaries we know that it was still used in the Arsacid period.169 163 Cf.

II. CEREMONIES, RITUALS AND FESTIVALS 
11.1. Introduction Important elements of the cult are the ceremony, the ritual and the religious festival. A ceremony is a religious custom or rite for the opening or continuation of contact between man and the divine. The ceremony, together with the seasons (with which it was originally closely connected), was the basis for the chronology of the cultic year: the fixed days of the months, on which the ceremonies had to be performed, resulted in a calendar which was based on the cult. Rituals and festivals consist of a complex of ceremonies, each of which have their own function, combined¡ together to serve a different purpose. In general this purpose consists in averting evil which may threaten an individual or the community, by following a 'fixed set of rules which describe how humans must serve the gods and in return enjoy a secure and pleasant life. The Mesopotamians offered mythological explanations for the cultic activities in the ritual texts. According to the Mesopotamians a ritual is often a re-enactment of a myth, because, as Lambert noted, they considered myths not to have happened once in a remote past, but were regarded to occur at regular intervals. I It is often difficult for us to assess how the Mesopotamians conceived a ritual to be connected with a particular myth. Sometimes the ritual itself contains an explanation. We also have explanatory texts which 'explain' some of these connections.2 As Livingstone concluded, because for the Mesopotamians there is no fundamental difference between myth and ritual, the statues and symbols which are used in the temple rituals are in fact the deities which they represent, and the rituals in which they take part are therefore myths. These myths usually deal with struggles between major deities, which are derived from mythological events described in the epics Enama elis and Anzu. People mentioned in the rituals correspond to victorious deities in the myths, while animals or objects correspond to defeated deities or demons. 3 In texts from Mesopotamia we find no clear definition of a ceremony. We do have an interesting áenumeration of several ceremonies from Uruk in TU 38, which describes the amount of foodstuffs and drinks which have to be brought into the temples daily. 4 1 See W.G. Lambert, JSS 13 (1968), 104ff., especially 112. A good example of a ritual explained by a , 	myth is the kettledrum ritual, see II.5.2. For a survey of the history and development of the myth and ritual debate i.e .¥ what came first, the myth or the ritual, see H.S. Versnel, Transition and reversal in myth and ritual, Leiden, New York, Koln, 19942 (Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman religion II. Studies in Greek and Roman religion, vol. 6, II), chapter I, 15-88. 2 The explanatory texts explaining temple rituals by equating them with myths are discussed by A. Living.stone, Mystical, 115 ff. (chapters 4---6).See also 1.2. 3 Mystical, 115 and 169 f. 4 The text is discussed in ill.2.2. 23 Obv. 35-38 mentions loaves and date cakes which are used for several offerings and ceremonies: ' 35 .¥¥ Not included are (also) the large(?) loaves and the date cakes 36which are for the travel provisions of the gods, the guqqu-offerings,the e.fsesu-ceremonies, the opening of the gate ceremonies, the clothing ceremonies, 37the holy water (basin) ceremonies, the night vigil ceremonies, the brazier ceremonies, the rites of the divine marriage, (the offerings ot) the karibus 38and the additional offerings of the king'. Apart from four groups of general offering gifts, 5 the loaves and date cakes are also intended for several ceremonies listed here: the monthly-celebrated essesu-ceremonies, 6 the daily-celebrated opening of the gate ceremonies (pit biibi),7 the monthly-celebrated clothing ceremonies (lubustu),8 the holy water (basin) ceremonies (egubbu), performed during purifications,9 the monthly-celebrated night vigil ceremonies (bajjiitu),10the brazier ceremonies (ldnunu),11 and the rites of the divine marriage (basiidu),performed during the New Year festival, but also on other occasions. 12 The reverse (35-38) mentions oxen and sheep for the same list of offerings and ceremonies (but without the travel provisions of the gods), and then adds (38-39): 'which are written down in (the tablets ot) the rites (par~u)for the whole year, in the Res: temple, the Esgal-temple, the Eanna-temple and the (other) temples ofTiranna (= Uruk) for Anu, Antu and all the ( other) gods'. The list in these two passages is apparently an attempt to present a complete description of the regularly recurring offerings and ceremonies during the cultic year in Uruk. This is confirmed by the fact that the text refers to the marriage-rites, but not to the Newá Year festival ( akitu),13 nor to any other ritual or festival, which was celebrated only once a year or on special occasions, e.g. the kettledrum ritual or the building ritual.14 The text mentions the opening of the gate ceremonies, but not the awakening of the temple ceremonies (dik biti),15 which may be explained by the close connection between these ceremonies. Note that the night vigil ceremonies are mentioned, but not the closely connected good-functioning of the temple ceremonies (saliim biti).16 Because the list on the obverse is identical with the one on the reverse (with the exception of the travel 5 The travel provisions of the gods (~iditu iliini, see ill.2), the monthly guqqt2-offerings (see III.7.2), the

II.2. Daily ceremonies provisions of the gods, only mentioned in the former), the possibility of the slovenliness of the writer can be excluded. Because it is difficult to ascertain any logical schedule in the nature or sequence of the ceremonies in this list, 17 in this chapter another order has been chosen: first we will analyse the group which has a cyclical basis, i.e. which are performed on a daily, monthly or yearly basis, 18 although, as we will see, it is often difficult to determine whether we are dealing with monthly or yearly ceremonies and rituals, or whether they occur only occasionally. Then a few special rituals are discussed: the kettledrum ritual, the building ritual and theá eclipse of the moon ritual. Finally we will analyse some festivals about which we know only little: a temple festival celebrated in Esabad, the temple of Gula in Babylon, a so-called palm festival in Esagila, a lzaru-ritualin Esagila, a Greek festival, two special festivals for Istar of Babylon and Bitar ofUruk respectively, and a nocturnal festival celebrated in the Res-temple complex. We will also discuss the so-called Ruler cults. : ¥ 11.2. Daily ceremonies The god was represented in the temple by an anthropomorphic statue, and therefore his daily life was taken care of by humans in an anthropomorphic way: ceremonies and rituals concentrated on the daily life in the temple and the meals which were served to the gods. An impo:rtfnt element of this daily practice was the divine meal, which will be discussed in chapter III. Furthermore two ceremonies are known which were performed every cultic day in the temples: the dik biti-and the pit biibi-ceremonies. They will be discuss~d in this section,. áBut first we must briefly analyse the cultic day. 11.2.1. The cu/tic day The Babylonian day (iimu) was divided into seasonally varying watches (m~~artu), three during the day and three during the night, and into twelve unchanging 'double hours' (beru).19A normal day began and ended with sunset,20 between the first and last . . .. 17 Accordingto G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 163, the fact that kinunufollowsbajjatuin the list indicates that the former took place during the night vigils. However, this could be accidental. Furthermore, it is not likely that the list in TU 38 follows a chronological order, since in TU 39, obv. 13 it is stated that the guqqu-offerings follow the clothing ceremonies (lubustu),whereas in TU 38, obv. 36 and rev. 36-37 they are mentioned before the clothing ceremonies. 18 B. Landsberger, K.ult. Ka/ender, 2 ff. for the first time suggested a separate discussion of ceremonies which were celebrated monthly and those which were celebrated yearly. 19 Cf. R. Borger, JEOL 18 (1964), 326-7; D. Pingree, E. Reiner, AJO25 (1974-77), 54f.; C.B.F. Walker, H. Hunger,MDOG 109 (1977), 33-4; M.A. Powell, in: RIA 7 (1989), 467f.; F.N.H. Al Rawi, A.R. George,

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals double hour of the day (her iimi),21 when 'the sun (god) stands' (Samas izzaz) on the horizon.22 The cultic day however had a different schedule23: -the dik biti (awakening of the temple)-ceremony 
-thepit biibi (opening of the gate )-ceremony 
-the serving and clearing of the two meals (naptanultardennu)24 in the morning 
-the serving and clearing of two meals in the evening 
-the closing of the gate 
It started at sunrise (napiibu sa samsi),25or more precise shortly before sunrise, during the (last) double hour of the night (ber miisi), before the gates of the temple were opened, with the dfk bfti-ceremony. The cultic day ended, after the two evening meals were served and cleared, with the closing of the gates. However, the beginning of the second cultic day of the New Year áfestival, held in the month Nisannu in Babylon, began two hours before dawn, i.e. the last double hour of the night and then began progressively earlier on each succeeding day, the third probably (the text is damaged) 1/3 double hours earlier, the fourth on 2/3 double hours earlier, until finally it began four hours before dawn, i.e. two double hours of the night,26 either during the middle or during the last night watch (slit urri).21 Cultic days, which included a night vigil ( bajjii.tu),28 had a different schedule29: -the dfk bfti-ceremony 
-thepit biibi-ceremony 
-the serving and clearing of the two meals of the morning 
-the serving (and clearing}lO of two meals of the evening 
21 See LKU, no. 51, obv. 7, 21, 26, rev. 36; TU 39, rev. 23 (the time of the main and second meal), see my comments on this line in the Appendix. 22 See C. Wilcke, in: M. Mindlin, M.J. Geller, J.E. Wansbrough (eds.), Figurative language in the Ancient Near East, London, 1987, 91. 23 See TU 39, rev. 15 ff., describing the normal proceedings of day 11 of the New Year festival ofTasritu in Uruk; at the end of the cultic day there is no mention of the closing of the gate but the text states (rev. 23-4): 'The main and second (meal) of the (last) double hour of the day in the usual manner ditto\ referring to the end of day 10 (rev. 14). 24 See also Ill.2.1. 2s Cf. TU 38, rev. 31; also in the Uruk night vigil ritual TU 41, rev. 28 and the Uruk eclipse of the moon ritualBRM 4, 6, rev. 31; see also the kettledrum ritual KAR 50, rev. 2 (Neo-Assyrian). 26 RAcc.,129, l; 132,157; 133,217; 136,285.Cf.G.J.P.McEwan,FAOS4, 171.SeenowalsotheHellenistic Temple ritual fragment BM 41577 (A.R. George,Studies W.G. Lambert, no. 1, 260ff.), col. III, 23, and perhaps col. II, 14 (also dealing with the month Nisannu). 27 In Babylon for half the year the night lasts less than 12 hours. This night was still divided into 3 watcpes, each of less than 4 hours(= 2 biru). If something occurred 2 blru before sunrise then during this half of the year it could not have occurred during the last watch, but during the middle watch. At the equinoxes (when day and night were realy equal to 6 biru each) 2 biru before sunrise is (ideally) at the beginning of the last watch of the night (slit urn). For the slit urri, the third and last watch of the night i.e. the morning watch, see also TU 48 (discussed in II.2.2), obv. 18. 2s See also 11.3.4 and II.8.6. 29 See TU 39, rev. 3 ff., describing days 9 and 10 of the New Year festival ofTasntu in Uruk; the beginning of day 9, with the dfk biti-and the pit blibi-ceremonies and the serving of the first morning meal, is lost. 30 TU 41, obv. 13 informs us that the meal is not cleared, the vigil continues the entire night, and the gate is not closed (that is: not yet closed at the beginning of the evening, as on a normal cultic day). -the night vigil -the closing of the gate On the following day: -the dik biti-ceremony -the pit biibi-ceremony -the end of the night vigil The vigil (which was the last cultic event of the cultic day) started after the serving and clearing of the two meals of the evening, and ended not when the gate was closed at the end of the night, but on the next day, after the dik biti-and pit babi-ceremonies were performed. In the ritual texts we also find other references to the time of day or night when a certain part of a ritual had to be performed. The New Year text from Babylon mentions cultic activiti"es taking place after I, I 1/2, and 1 2/3 double hours of daytime have past (ber iimu isqa).31In two cases the texts refer to the evening watch i.e. the first watch of the night (bariirf.tu).32 More often, however, the texts are less specific, referring to dawn (namiiru),33to the late afternoon (sa ~umi, lit. 'that of the cool of the day'),34 to the evening (lilatu),35or to the night (miisu).36 II.2.2. dik bfti The first cultic ceremony of the day was the dik biti 'awakening of the temple'.ceremony.37 It was performed during the last night watch, just before the end of the night vigil, before dawn, and before the gates were opened. The ceremony is attested in text9from the Neo-Assyrian and the Hellenistic periods. The function of the ceremony is never explicitly described, but probably-the 'awakening' or 'arousing' of the temple refers to both the residents of the temple, the gods, and the priests, who have to wake up the gods to start a new day. The dik biti-ceremony was probably performed at the beginning of every cultic day, and was not a ceremony for special occasions.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals it is not clear how exactly the ceremony was performed, we lrnow that an important element of the ceremony was the reciting of lamentations (taqribtu and ersemakku) for the most important gods of the pantheon. Important evidence for the dfk bfti-ceremony comes from three texts, which indicate that there was a fixed liturgy involving the taqribtu-lamentations for certain days of each month; the purpose of reciting the lamentations was to ensure that any offence (unlrnowingly) commited against the gods would be neutralized. 38 One text is TU 48, a calendar text from Hellenistic Uruk. Very similar to this text are K 2724 +, a calendar text from the Neo-Assyrian period, found in Assur, and BM 50503, a calendar text from Neo-/Late Babylonian Sippar. All texts concentrate on the lamentation priests only, leaving the activities of other priests aside. 39 We will start with the text from Assur. K 2724 + The Neo-Assyrian text K 2724 + lists lamentations recited to Assur in the city Assur in the temple of Dagan and in Esarra (but also lamentations recited to Ninlil (Mullissu), Marduk and Istar). 40 The lamentations were recited by the lamentation priest. The text apparently began with the month Tasritu.41 The preserved portion of the text describes the liturgy from Saba!U up to the eleventh day of Nisannu.

However, it is nor clear whether the lamentations recited before these offerings, 43 See the parallels in obv. 11', 151, and 19'. also belong to the dfk bfti-ceremony, or form a separate ceremony. The latter is suggested by day 22, where lamentations are recited in two different temples. BM50503 This text from Sippar, which was only recently published by Stefan Maul,44 was according to the latter probably written during the late 8th and late 6th century B.C. It consists of a cultic calendar for Samas, Aja and Bunene in Ebabbar, with lamentations and ritual instructions for four days: the first day is not indicated, but must be one of the first seven days of the month, since the second day indicated is the 8th, followed by the 15th and the 20th. The first day on which the lamentations were recited is probably day 1, as Stefan Maul convincingly argued.45The month during which these cultic activities. are performed is the first month of the year (Nisannu ), but the last Jines of the text make it clear that the instructions also had to be used for the rest of the year.46 During these four days taqribtusand ersemakkusare to be recited for Samas before sunrise, during the dfk biti-ceremony, and before sunset (lam lilatz). Here we will concentrate on the lamentations recited during the dfk biti-ceremony 47: -on day l(?!) of every month: the taqribtuABZU PE.EL.LA.AM, and the ersemakku DILMUN NiGIN.NA; -on day 8 of every month: the taqribtuU4.DAM KI AM.MU.US, and the ersemakku UMUN BARA KU.GA; -on day 15 of every month: the taqribtu AM.E AMAS.A.NA, and the ersemakku UR.SAG ABZU.TA; -on day 20 of every month: the taqribtuU4.DE U4.DE, and the ersemakkuUR.SAG UT.Vis.LU. The text presents us with clear evidence that the dik biti-ceremonywas performed before dawn (inaserz).48 TU48 In a liturgical calendar text from Hellenistic Uruk,49 TU 48, we also find a schedule of hymns to be recited with various offerings associated with the dfk bf ti-ceremony for various days, performed by lamentation priests in the Ubsukkinaku, the central courtyard in the Res-complex, in front of the Anu-Antu-temple.s 0 44 In: Munuscula Mesopotamica.

know, not attested elsewhere. The colophon refers to him as 'apprentice lamentation priest', indicating that

After day 1, 7 and 15, we go back to day 14, apparently of Aragsamna, as in rev. 9. Rev. 7-8 refers neither to the dfk bfti-ceremony nor to the month Arab,samna, but the text is not without mistakes. The text gives in chronological order the days on which the taqribtu-lamentationshad to be recited every month, interrupted by lamentations on special days: first, in obv. 1-17, day I, 2 and 7 of every month, followed by day 1, 2 and 15 of Nisannu; then picking up the chronological order with day 15 and 20 of every month. Secondly, in obv. 18-rev. 10 (during the dfk bfti-ceremony), day I, 7 and 15 of every month, followed by day 14 and 18 of Arab,samna; then picking up the chronological order with day 20, which however is not written since the text is 67 G.J.P. McEwan (FAOS4, 172, n. 404) already noted that, since the text says it is not complete (rev. 10), is it likely that the original tablet contained a separate entry concerning the lamentations performed during the dfk biti-ceremony for the 20th of each month. incomplete. Two lamentations on the 14th of every month after one lamentation on the 15th is not likely. First of all it would contradict the chronology of the whole text. Also, if the 14th and 15th were alternative days, one would expect Anu (the most important god of Hellenistic Uruk) to be celebrated first, and so the 14th would be dedicated to Anu, and the 15th to !star; compare the other alternative days in obv. 1--4, where the 1st day is dedicated to Anu, the 2nd to !star. Therefore the two lamentations on the 14th are probably special lamentations for Arabsamna, together with the following lamentation on the 18th (rev. 9). However, because in the text there is no reference to Arabsamna, McEwan considered day 14 to refer to every month. 68He suggested that the second day for every month in cycle A, dedicated to !star, is an alternative day for the 1st day, dedicated to Anu, and the 14th day in cycle B, dedicated to !star, referring to every month, is an alternative day for the 15th, dedicated to Anu. All the other days refer to both gods at the same time. Based on this he deduced a different cultic pattern for the Res-temple of Anu and Antu, and the Esgal-temple oflstar and Nanaja: (a) taqribtu-Iamentations to Anu in the Res-temple on days 1, 7, 15 and 20, and to !star in the Esgal-temple on days 2, 7, 15 and 20. (b ): taqribtu-lamentations during the dfk Mi-ceremony to Anu in the Res-temple on days 1, 7, 15 and (20), and to !star in the Esgal-temple on days 1, 7, 14 and (20). We must conclude that, since day 14 is not an alternative day for day 15, the two cultic patterns of Anu in the Res-temple and !star (and Nanaja) in the Esgal-temple differ from each other on only one day, the 1st/2nd. McEwan identifies the four monthly festivals in TU 48, celebrated on the 1st/2nd, 7th, 15th and 20th days, with the monthly recurring clothing ceremony (lubustu) and the often connected bitpu-offerings.69 His first argument is that TU 48, obv. 14 refers to lubustu. Unfortunately the data for the days on which lubustu is celebrated in the Neo-Babylonian and Hellenistic periods do not exactly match the days of TU 48.7¡ Furthermore, McEwan argues, we know that the bilj}u-offerings in the Neo-Babylonian period were made on four regular recurring days, for which also alternative days are attested. But again, these days also do not exactly match the days mentioned in TU 48.71 However, we must keep in mind that, apart from TU 48, we have only one more dated reference to lubustu from the Hellenistic period; from the Neo-Babylonian period we have more, but we cannot exclude the possibility that major changes concerning lubustu may have occured after the Neo-Babylonian period. So, although McEwan may be right, the only certain reference in TU 48 to lubustu is the one on day 20 of every month (obv. 14). Whether the other days refer to lubustu cannot (for now) be established with certainty. Comparing the three texts, we find that TU 48 is in many ways very similar to K 2724 + and BM 50503: . 68 Although he'a!so noted the 'generally laconic nature of the text', cf. FAOS4, 172-3, with n. 405.

11.2.Daily ceremonies I. TU 48, BM 50503 and K 2724 + deal with all the months, although the Assur-text only mentions the months Sabaµi, Addaru and Nisannu. The latter text is not complete, however. Apparently the Assur-and Sippar-texts have a different cult schedule for every month, while the Uruk-text uses one month as the model for the entire year; the days referred to in BM 50503 (l[?!]-8-15-20) and TU 48 (1-7-15-20) are similar, but not completely identical. The dfk bzti-ceremony is used in both K 2724 + and TU 48 with the taqribtu-lamentationsdUTU.GIN1 E.TA,12 UD.DAM Kl AM.MU.US73 and AM.E/ME AMAS.A.NA.74although for different days. Furthermore, TU 48 has the same taqribtu for the first day of every month as BM 50503, ABZU PE.EL.LA.AM,75 but in the latter text not during the dflcbfti-ceremony (here instead dUTU.GIN1 E.TA), while the taqribtus for days 8 and 15 in the BM-text (U4.DAM KI AM.MU.US and AM.E AMAS.A.NA) are performed in TU 48 during the dfk bfti-ceremony on days 7 and 15.76 Interestingly enough we have other texts, for instance the building rituals TU 45 and 46,77 which enumerate lamentations, but do not mention the specific days and month on which they had to be recited; they only state: 'in an auspicious month, on a favourable day' (ina ITI sal-mu ina UD SE.GA). 2. 'Iwo taqribtu-lainentations, which are attested in TU 48 (rev. 1 and 6), are also mentioned in the New Year ritual TU 39 from Uruk. In this text the cukbi'ti-ceremony is attested for 3 days of the month Tasritu, although we must assume that the cuk bfti: ceremony was performed every cultic day. The first seven days of the New Year festival are presented in a very abbreviated version, with only one remark on day 6 (TU 39, obv. 6) and a few short remarks on day 7 ( obv. 7-15), including a reference to the cuk Mi-ceremony (obv. 7); it was performed by the lamentation priests (as in TU 48), but no lamentation incipits are enumerated. In the same line the cook (nu"!Jatimmu)is also mentioned; although he is not referred to as one of the performers of the ceremony, it may indicate that, similar to the pit biibi-ceremony (see below), foodstuffs were used during the ceremony (TU 39, obv. 7-10)'! á ,. '7Day 7: the awakening of the temple ceremony (performed) by the lamentation priests and the singers. (As to) the cook: food and songs of jubilation, 8roasted meat, beef and mutton for the regular offerings, all sorts of fine beer, 9including drawn wine and milk, date confection, fine mixed beer and labku-mixedbeer, IOfirimtu-cups(?), dannu-and nambaru-vats(shaped like) raven(?) for Papsukkal and Guskinbanda', Days 8 to 11 are described extensively. Although the beginning of day 8 is preserved (TU 39, obv. 16ff.) and the pit biibi-ceremony is mentioned, the cuk biti-ceremony is, strangely, not referred to here. The beginning of day 9 is lost. The di'kbfti ceremony is also mentioned for the last two days of the festival: on day 10 the cukbfti-ceremony is performed by reciting the taqribtu-lamentationsUMUN SE.ER.MA.AL AN.Kl.A 72 K 2724+,obv.10, TU 48, obv. 19.

and AN E.LU4.UM.MA (11139, rev. 10-11). The latter is also attested in TU 48 (rev. 6) for the 15th day of every month. On day 11 the dfk bfti-ceremony is performed by reciting AM.E AMAS.AN.NA and E.LUM DI.DI.RA (111 39, rev. 15-16). The latter is also attested in 111 48 (rev. 1) for the first day of every month. For day 10 and 11 the moment when the ceremony was performed is further indicated by ina musi 'in the night'; for these days the text also records that the ceremony takes place shortly before the pft biibi-ceremony. This agrees with TU 48, where ( as we already noted above) the lamentations were recited 'in the morning watch' (obv. 18). As Cohen noted, because on days 10 and 11 of the New Year festival an assembly of the gods took place, in which the fate for next year was determined, the recitation of the taqribtus and their ersemakkus in order to appease the anger of the gods was of great . importance. 78 Table I: dik bfti-ceremonies from Hellenistic Uruk day  month(s)  text  7  VII  TU 39,obv. 7  [9]  [VII]  TU40,obv.  10  VII  TU 39, rev. 11  11  VII  TU 39, rev. 16  1  I/XII  TU 48, rev. 1  7  I/XII  TU 48, rev. 3  15  I/XII  TU 48, rev. 5  14  {VIII)  TU48,rev.  7  (20)  I/XII  TU48  II.2.3. pit biibi Thepit babi 'opening of the gate'-ceremony is known from the Old Babylonian period on.79 Although it remains unclear how exactly the ceremony was performed, we know that the ceremony took place just before dawn in the temples, after the dfkbfti-ceremony and together they formed the beginning of all cultic activities inaugurating the new day. We must assume that the pit biibi-ceremony (just like the dfk bfti-ceremony) was performed on every cultic day of the year. It was probably not a ceremony fo.r special occasions, nor was its first aim to let the people enter the temple on the occasion of a feast, as suggested by LandsbergerSO and Weidner, 81 but rather the opening of the gate(s) indicates the time in the morning when all the priests and craftsmen who had to perform their usual duties in the temple (erib bftz) were allowed to enter the temple. 78 Ersemma,SO.

From the pre-Hellenistic periods we have a few references to the day(s) on which the ceremony was performed: a sheep is slaughtered on the 11th before Sin for the pft biibi-ceremony in KAJ 199.82 The ceremony is celebrated on the 4th of Ululu in the lettersLAS I, no. 285,83 and ABL 496,84 and on the 4th, 5th and 6th ofUlulu in LAS I, no. 287.85 The fourth month Du'fizu is identified as the 'month of the opening of the gate' (arabpft blibi).86 Uruk For the Hellenistic period pit biibi is attested in several ritual texts from Uruk. The gate referred to in texts from Uruk is the biibusaAnu u Antu, i.e. the gate of the Anu-Antu.temple in the Res-complex.87 In TU 38pft biibi is one of the ceremonies enumerated in the list of ceremonies. 88 This text also informs us that loaves and date cakes and oxen and sheep are used during the ceremony. 89 In the ritual text TU 39--40 we have attestations of pft biibi-ceremonies for the 8th, 10th and 11th days of the month Tasritu. 90 The beginning of day 9,probably with the pft blibi-ceremony, is lost. As we already saw in the previous paragraph, the first seven days are gresented in an abbreviated form. Although the drk biti-ceremony is mentioned for the 7th day, the pit biibi-ceremonyis not referred to here. Thepit biibi-ceremonyis also known from TU 41, describing special ceremonies during the vigil held during the night of the 16th and 17th ofTebetu(?).91 When the night was over, after all the necessary ceremonies were performed, the gate was opened and the vigil ended.92 In BRM 4, 6, the pit blibi-ceremony is performed on the day after the eclipse of the moon.93 Thepit babi-ceremony is also known from other texts from Hellenistic Uruk. In two calendar texts (VAT 7816 and 781594) theprt biibi-ceremony is attested for days 4, 6 and 7 ofNisannu,95 and for days 4, 5 and 30.ofKislimu.96 82 Obv. 3. 83 A, 7'. 84 Obv. 10. 85 Rev. 3-5.

' If this reading is correct, then apparently part of the income of the erib bitiitu-and tiibibiitu-prebend consisted of foodstuffs, which were also used as offerings during, and therefore associated with, the pzt biibi-ceremony. This is quite possible, since the foodstuffs which are mentioned here remind us of the date cakes and oxen and sheep, used for (amongst others) the pit biibi-ceremony mentioned in TU 38. Finally, the pit biibi-ceremony is also attested in an astrological text from Hellenistic Uruk, which concerns the zodiacal system,IOO From the twelve signs of the zodiac eight signs (Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer) are associated with the opening of the gate ceremonies of various gods. See the following schedule: Leo (Abu) pft biibi Enlil Virgo (Ulfilu) pit biibi Sin, !star Libra (Tasntu) pit biibi Sin, Samas, Istar, Anu, Enlil, Ea, Ningirsu Scorpius (Arag.samna) pit biibi Allatu, Nergal Sagittarius (Kislimu} pit biibi Pabilsag, Ninurta Aries (Nisannu) pit biibi Marduk, Ninurta Taurus (Ajjaru} pft biibi Ninurta Gemini (Simiinu} pit biibi Sin, Samas, Nergal Cancer (Du'uzu) pit biibi Samas, Sulpae However, Weidner pointed out that instead of referring to the twelve months of the year, the cultic instructions may also refer to the twelve parts of the month, of 2 1/2 days each. 101 97 See also 11.3.1.

W.G. Lambert,JCS 11.3. Monthly ceremonies The twelve months of the Babylonian year lasted 29 or 30 days each and they began with the first sighting of the crescent of the new moon in the evening.105 During every month special ceremonies were ce]ebrated which were connected with certain fixed days of the month. See for example TU 38, which refers to a purification, the cleansing of the hands ceremony (tebibtu qiiti)106: it was celebrated every month (ar!Jussu)on day 16 for Anu and Antu, exactly as was a specia] yearly celebrated ceremony on day 16 of the tenth month Tebetu (rev. 32-34, see the Appendix): '32Qn day 16, monthly, 34(the priest) will offer 3210 first-quality sheep, fat (and) pure, whose horns and hooves are perfect, 33forAnu and Antu of Heaven and the 7 planets, as cooked meat, on occasion of34the cleansing of the hands ceremony (te-bi-ib-tu4 SU11), in the Baramab on the temple tower of Anu,just like on day 16 ofTebetu'. Some monthly ceremonies are only identified by the name(s) of the god(s) for which the ceremony is celebrated. Other monthly ceremonies which are attested in the texts are specifically named ( essesu, lubustu, bajjiitu, nubattu, saliim bftz); it is usually not specifically stated that they were performed monthly and the days are also often not mentioned in the Hellenistic period.107 However, as we shall see, it is clear from texts of earlier periods and from the context in which they appear that they were monthly ceremonies. Also, we have an indication that a regular pattern of days used for cult activities was in practice in Hellenistic Babylon: an astronomical diary states that on days 1, 3, 7, 15,. and 16 of the twelfth month Addaru a ritual procedure (nepesu) was performed, for which ma!J!Juru-offerings were presented (mab-!Ju-ru un-da!J-fJi-ru).108 On the obverse of the tablet the eleventh month is discussed, and here we find a ritual procedure of the gods (ne-pes sa DINGIR.MES), for which ma!J!Juru-offeringsare also presented; the passage continues with a reference to the chief singer of dirges, who recites(?) ersa!Jungu-tablets.Whether these two ritual procedures are identical is difficult to say, because of the damaged state of the passages. Nevertheless, the days mentioned here remind us of the days attested for the monthly ceremonies discussed here; although the name of the ritual procedure is lost, one of the above-named monthly ceremonies seems a likely candidate. We will begin this section by describing the known unspecified monthly ceremonies ' and then tum our attention to the monthly celebrated ceremonies which are known by a specific name: essesu, lubustu, bajjiitu, nubattu, sa/am bfti. 10s See P.-A.Beaulieu,ZA 83 (1993), 66 ff. 106 See Ill.6.3. 101 Cf. G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 171 ff. 108 A.J. Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries,no. -229, B, rev. 13'. The mahburu-offering is discussed in m.7.2. 11.3.l. Unspecified monthly ceremonies Most of the unspecified monthly ceremonies come from legal documents concerning prebend shares.109 Several unnamed monthly ceremonies for Anu, Antu, Enlil, !star, Nanaja, Belet-sa-Res, Belet-miiti, Belet-~eri, Papsukkal, and also for the statues of the kings, are attested in the Hellenistic prebend texts from Uruk. The reference to the monthly recurring character of a ceremony is presented in several different ways, which we will illustrate with a few examples.1IO 1. A ceremony can be referred to without a date or any other further specification. In OECT 9, 42,111 obv. 12, before two annual ceremonies for Papsukkal and Antu,112 a monthly ceremony for Enlil and !star is mentioned, but no reference is made to the monthly recurring character of this ceremony, and a S!)ecific day is also not indicated: 10 3[0(?)]-'-u ina GIS.SUB.BA1uKU4 Epi-ris-tu4-u-tu u !uKlJ.[DIM]-u-tu MU.MES 11 inaUDU.NiTA.MESsa bi-it-pi.MES sa tug/u-bu-us-tu4-a-tu.MES ina UZU b[a-a]s-lu 12 [u] ina UZU ba-al-tu sa UDU.NiTA.MES¤a a-na giABANSURstidEN.LiLu dINNIN Eu-u . . 13 ina GU4baMUSENbiu UDU.SIL~ sa ina UD.17.KAMsaiiipU6 a-na gi!BANSURsa dPM.SUKKAL 14 E11-uina GU4(balMUSEN(h!lu VDU.SIL~ sa ina UD.8.KAMsa itiSEa-na giiBANSURsaAn-tu4 .15 Ewu ¥' 10one-thirtieth of these erib bft piristutu-and kutimmiitu-prebends11in the sheep of the !Jitpu-offerings of the clothing ceremonies, in the cooked 12and raw mutton, which are brought up to the table of ~il and !star (monthly), 13in the beef, birds and lamb, which 14are brought up 13to the table of Papsukkal (once a year) on day 17 ofTastitu, 14in the beef, birds and lamb, which 1sarebrought up 14to the table of Antu (once a year) on the day 8 of Addaru, .. .'. 2.

FAOS4, 67-120; B. Funck, Uruk zur Seleukidenzeit, 56-277. So far no prebend docwnents from Babylon

Menant, Doc. jur., no. 5 (BM 93004), 117several monthly ceremonies ( always without arbussu) for different deities and one for the statues of the kings are mentioned. After a monthly ceremony for Belet-mati, and another for Anu and Antu (obv. 9-131 18), and before a monthly ceremony for Nanaja on the essesu-days,and another for the statues of the kings on the essesu-days(obv. 17-19), two monthly ceremonies are menti'oned for Belet-~eri on day 4 and for Papsukkal and Belet-~eri on day 13, and furthermore a monthly ceremony for ls tar on day 3 ( obv. 13-17): 13 ...

Interestingly fowl is not mentioned, although it is attested for the unnamed annual ceremonies. 122 Many of the texts also mention the essesu-ceremony, discussed below: we find that the unnamed monthly ceremonies do not refer to a specific day, when they are celebrated on an essesu-day. then the specific day When they are not celebrated on an essesu-day, is mentioned. Thus, in VS 15, 37, six ceremonies are mentioned, of which four are dated 119 Cf. S. Sherwin-White, A. Kuhrt, From Samarkhand to Sardis, 224.

Oppert,J.Menant,Doc.jur., no. 5 (BM 93004) dates five ceremonies to specific days, and two to the essesu-days. II.3.2. essesu essesu(written (UD) ES.ES)is a ceremony with a long history.123 It is attested from the Ur III period up to the Hellenistic period.124ES.ESis according to Jacobsen best translated 'all temple' (ES=temple) or "'general" festival' rather than 'monthly festival' and in the Ur III period it was celebrated in all the temples.125 The ceremony was held on days 1, 7 and 15of each month, corresponding to the phases of the moon.126 Between the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods, in texts from Ur, the number is raised to 4 by adding day 25. Because this day cannot easely be connected with a phase of the moon, from this moment on the essesu-dayswere apparently no longer linked to lunar phases.127In the Middle Babylonian period the days were changed to days 4, 8 and 17 of each month. The Neo-Babylonian period ¥While in Assyria an essesu-dayas a ceremony is not attested,128 in the Neo-Babylonian period, especially in texts from Uruk, up to 11 days per month are connected with essesu,but they almost never mention the specific dates of these days. We will give two examples. The first is GC 1,209,129 a statement of honey used on essesu-days: Obv. 1 8 NINDAbA LALb¥sa[gu-u]q(?)-qu

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals dates and raisins,144 Dilrnun dates, dried figs and raisins,145 dried figs and raisins,146 emmer,147 sesame,148 barley,149 and meat.ISO In four texts from the Neo-Babylonian period we find that the essesu-ceremonyis connected with other ceremonies and offerings. In J. MacGinnis, AfO 38-39 (1991-92), 89 it is connected with the bajjiitu-151and saliimbfti-ceremonies,1s2 and with the ginu-, guqqu-, niqe sarri-, and niqe karibi-offerings,153in BIN 2, 129 with the lubustu-, nabru.and bajjiitu-ceremonies,154in VS 6, 268 also with the saliim bfti-and bajjiitu-ceremonies, and in GC 1, 199 with the kinunu-ceremony.155The connection.between the essesu-and the saliim Mi-ceremony is clear from a Neo-Assyrian letter (LAS I, 280, rev. ICr-18), where the regular offerings (ginu) are presented, and incense is poured onto a censer on the essesu-day(and?) at the saliim bfti-ceremony. Although we must assume that the essesu-ceremonywas performed during every month of the year,156 only the months IV and VII/XI are attested in Uruk, and month III in Babylon, which, however, is not surprising considering the small number of texts that we have. The number of essesu-days,however, from one to eleven, is astonishing, because in the earlier periods we know of only three or four. Were these ceremonies celebrated for more than one god? Or is the month mentioned in the given text only the first month for the essesu in question? This does not seem very likely. There is another possibility: if, for example, we concentrate on the receipts of honey,157 we see that these texts have as their central topic not the essesu-ceremonies. The ceremonies are mentioned only as secondary information, necessary to describe the amount of the relevant foodstuff, needed for a certain month. So perhaps we should re-translate the relevant section as: 'PN has brought x honey (to the amount) of x esse.su-offerings (usually brought in) month x'. Because the actual days are almost never recorded (only the letter TCL9, 134 refers to day 20), it remains unclear whether the same days from earlier periods were used or not. One must assume that these days were well-known, and mentioning them was not considered necessary. In any case, it becomes clear that, especially in Neo-Babylonian Uruk, essesuwas still a very frequently and regularly performed monthly ceremony. ' 144 YOS6, 39 (qul/upu-cake); AUWE 5, 80 ([qul/upu-cake]).

11.3.Monthly ceremonies The Hellenistic period For the Hellenistic period the essesu-ceremony is well attested, especially in texts from Uruk.158 However, the texts do not provide us with complete information because, as in the Neo-Babylonian period, they never record the specific dates for the essesu-days, again probably because they were well-known. This ls confirmed by our list of unnamed monthly ceremonies from Hellenistic Uruk, discussed above, which are not specifically dated when they are celebrated on an essesu-day.If the days from earlier periods were also used in the Hellenistic period, then we must, for example assume that the saliim blti=and bajjiitu-ceremonies, performed during the night of the sixteenth in Uruk, and described in TU 41,159 were followed by an essesu-ceremony on day 17, since this was an essesu-dayin earlier periods. In prebend texts from Hellenistic Uruk the essesu-ceremonyis attested many times, often mentioned as a pair with the guqqu-offerings, using the phrase: Sam-us-su kal MU.AN.NAgu-uq-qa-ne-e DD.ES.ES.MES 'monthly for the whole year, the guqqu-and essesu-offerings',160 The commodities used for these ceremonies served substantially to provide an income for the prebend holders. However, the composition of these commodities is almost never described. Fortunately we have four prebend sales, which present us wim some information.

Dated to 670 B.C. by S. Parpola, LAS II, 282. The Neo-Babylonian period In his dissertation, Bongenaar discussed the clothing ceremonies of Samas in Sippar.174 BM 91002, a royal inscription of Nabii-apla-iddina (ninth century)I75 contains such regulations for days 7-I, 10-II, 3-VI, 7-VII, 15-VIII and 15-XII of the year; thus six ceremonies a year are listed. Bongenaar has demonstrated that these data are very similar to the data found in Neo-Babylonian administrative clothing texts from Sippar,176 We will compare these numbers with relevant texts from Neo-Babylonian Uruk and Babylon.

The texts, all but one (ABL 496) from Uruk, are administrative documents with the exception of LKU, nos. 47 and 51, which are ritual texts andABL 496, which is a Neo.Babylonian letter from Babylon, recording a lubustu for Bel on day 3-VI. Other gods which are attested for the lubustu are Nergal for days 8-11; 17-IV; 28-X, Gula for day 24-VIII, and Aska'itu and Nergal for day 26-IX,182 Furthermore a lubustu for Sama¤ and Aska'itu is recorded,183 For the clothing ceremonies, oil,184 sesame,1ss woo1,1s6 sheep,187 and finally payments, 188 silver for burdsu-incense,189 and /ubaru-clothing are attested.190 The evidence is scarce. From Uruk, especially informative is NCBT 1132, which mentions 8-11, 17-IV, 24-VIII, 26-IX, 28-X, and day 16 of an unlrnown month. It does not mention lubustuin month I and VI, as in Sippar, but it does mention month IV (also in GC 1,242), IX(also in BIN 2, 129) andX, which are not found in the Sipparcalendar in BM 91002 (referred to above). Furthermore, the ritual text LKU, no. 51 records the first day of month V, VI, and VII, and day 1, together with day 16 of month VI, is also attested in BIN l, 152. The days attested for the clothing ceremony in Uruk are very different from the Sippar days, but they do not allow us to establish a clear monthly schedule of days on which the ceremony was celebrated. Although lubustuis, as we will see below, connected with the bitpu-offeringsin prebend texts from Hellenistic Uruk, which ~e performed on days 6/7, 13/14, 20/21 and 27 /28 of each month, the attested data for Neo-Babylonian Uruk do not match this lJitpu-sequence.It is clear, however, that, while the ceremony was celebrated in Sippar during six months of the year, in Neo-Babylonian Uruk eight months are attested; whether lubustuwas celebrated during every month remains unclear for now. 181 Published by P.-A.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals As we saw, the only reference from Babylon, ABL 496, mentions day 3-VI, which is also attested in the letter LAS I, 285, and furthermore it is also one of the lubustu-days in Sippar. Obviously this is not enough to draw any conclusions as regards the data of lubustu in Babylon, but it may be an indication that the /ubustu-schedule in Babylon was more similar to that in Sippar than to that in Uruk. The Hellenistic period While from Hellenistic Babylon no references to lubustu are known, the ceremony is well attested in texts from Hellenistic Uruk.191The following gods are connected with the clothing ceremony: Antu; 192 Anu, Enlil, Naniija and Belet-sa-Res;I93 Anu, Antu and the great gods (ilanu rabutu);l94 and Anu.'95 Apparently the ceremony was connected with all, or at least with the more important gods of the pantheon ofUruk, and was not confined to one god. lubustuis one of the ceremonies recorded in a list of offerings and ceremonies in the ritual text TU 38 (obv.36, rev. 37), informing us that apparently loaves and cakes, and oxen and sheep were used during the ceremony. Another reference to the clothing ceremonies is recorded in TU 48, a cultic calendar :from Uruk,196 which mentions day 20 of every month; this day is not attested in the Neo-Babylonian period. lubustu is also frequently mentioned in prebend texts from Hellenistic Uruk, but the dates of the days are never recorded. OECT 9, 40,197 obv. 3 speaks of the clothing ceremonies for every year: 2 ... mi-sil ina UZIJZAG.LUUDU.NiTAsa l,i-it-pi.MES [ ... ](?)

McEwan, FAOS4, 163-4. 192 OECT 9, 40. 193 OECT 9, 50. 194 OECT 9, 60. 195 TU 48, obv. 14. 196 Discussed in 11.22. 197 Datelost. 198 OECT 9, 42, 45 /146, 50, and 60.Other erib bit piri!tutu + kutimmiltuprebends do not mention lubu!tu, but they are very damaged (OECT 9, 33; 44 (but with bitpu); 51; 57; 68; VS 15, 37 (but with !Jitpu)).Not damaged is OECT 9, 54 II 55, but this text is actually a quitclaim. OECT 9, 50, obv. 5---7, mentions the garments ldtu, ~uppatu and b~anatu, besides bitapatil Ia ana lubustu; which is a clear indication that the former ;were not mentioned in place of the latter in texts where lubu!tu is missing. OECT 9, 40 may be a kutimmiltu-prebend(.MKI '~KU.DIM.MES, cf. G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 89) and also mentions the yitpu.offerings of the /ubu!tu-ceremonies {obv. 2-3: !Ji-it-pi.MES[ ... ] [ia <¥¥s'l)/u]-bu-!a-a-tu gab-bi .MAn-tl4 ...). 199 SeeIl.3.1. sources for these prebends; the goldsmith (kutimmu) was responsible for the ornaments and garments of the statues of the gods, stored in the bzt piristi. In these texts, /ubustu is mentioned in connection with the l,itpu-offerings, using the phrase 'the bitpu-offerings of (sa) the clothing ceremonies'; saapparently has to be 'interpreted as 'belonging to', i.e. 'offerings presented during the clothing ceremonies'. The reference to the ox in the New Year ritual text TU 39, obv. 12200 may refer, as McEwan has pointed out,201 to the bitpu-offerings, because here these offerings are also mentioned in connection with lubustu. However, in the prebend texts the l,itpu.offerings always consist of sheep. In OECT 9, 60,202obv. 7 it is specifically stated that the lzitpu-offerings are performed on the lubustu-days:. 6 ... 60-'-u ina GIS.SUB.BA 1uKU4 EAD.:t[AL-u-tu

(to the table monthly) ... '. Fossey has studied several texts belonging to a small archive of the Eanna-temple in Uruk, mostly dating from the reigns of Cyrus and Cambyses (539-522), in which offerings of sheep and goats in the temple for each day of one particular month are described_203 Among these lzitpu-offerings are often mentioned. As Beaulieu has shown, 204 they involved the offering of a kid at average intervals of seven days, four times a month, usually on days 6/7, 13/14, 20/21 and 27/28 of each month. However, other days for these lzitpu-offerings are also attested and apparently the inconsistency of the system was caused by the fact that the lzitpu-offerings were tied to the four lunar phases. These phases varied from 6.75 to 7.75 days and this could explain the variety in the intervals between the ceremonies. Thus the bitpu-off erings, and also other cultic events like the clothing ceremony, could take place a day earlier or later than the average seven days interval date, and since lzitpu and lubustu appear to be connected in the Hellenistic prebend texts, they might have taken place on the same day. Although the only certain monthly date for lubustu from Hellenistic Uruk is 20-I/XII (TU 48), it does fit the schedule of the !Jitpu-days, and therefore it is not unlikely that the clothing ceremony in Hellenistic Uruk was performed on days 6/7, 13/14, 20/21 and 27 /28 of each month. Similar to the essesu-ceremony, the fact that the days are not mentioned in the texts probably means that these were well-known and that it was not necessary to mention them. 200 See 11.4.2.

The foodstuffs which were presented for the ceremony consisted of bread and butter,214 Dilmun dates,215 Dilmun dates(?) and raisins,216 sesame,211 barley,21s and meat.219 The Hellenistic period In texts from the Hellenistic period we have a few examples of bajjlitu.220The ceremony is attested in an administrative document, CT 49, 150, from Babylon. The text contains a list of temple expenditures; the relevant passage22I mentions4 shekels for the b11jjatu.ceremony of day 16 of month IX, and day 3 of month XI.222 We only have a few examples from Uruk, and only in ritual texts, but they are important because they provide us with insight into the way the ceremony was performed. Firstly bajjatu is recorded in TU 38, in the above mentioned list recording several offerings and ceremonies;22J from this passage it becomes clear that loaves and cakes and oxen and sheep were apparently used during the ceremony. Secondly, iná TU 39 we have a description of the vigil held during the night of days 9 and 10 of the seventh month Tasritu, during the second New Year festival in Uruk: the relevant passage224 describes that in the evening of day 9 the second meal of the morning is cleared, and the first main meal of the evening is served. After a censer is filled,offerings presented, and a recitation is performed by the singers, this meal is cleared and the second meal of the evening is served. The singers perform the same recitation again, the second meal is not yet cleared, the vigil goes on the entire night, and the gate is closed: ¥ '9 .¥¥ (the meal) will not be cleared. The vigil will continue the entire night (ba-a-a-at i-ba-at). The gate will be closed'. Then the description of day 10 begins: after two lamentations and the awakening of the temple ceremony (dfk bfti) are performed, the gate is opened and the vigil ends: '11At dawn the gate will be opened and the vigilwill be ended (ba-a-a-atDU:ij-ma)'. 209 BIN 1, 152; BIN 2, 129.

t)Je text continues with the description of the rest of day 10. After the serving of the two.meals of the morning and the evening the gate is closed and the day ends. . extensive description of a night vigil is recorded in 'FU 41. The text describes a special nocturnal festival held in the Res-temple of Anu during the vigil of days 16 and 17of an unknown month, perhaps the tenth month Tebetu. 225The ceremonies celebrated'¥during this night, including a procession with a torch, an extra meal, and . a salam bfti~'ceremony, are probably ceremonies for a special occasion and were not performed during every vigil. These ceremonies will be discussed below,226 but the standard proceedings of the vigil are the same as in ro 39: the evening meal is served but not cleared away, the vigil continues the entire night (ba-a-a-at i-ba-at),221 and the gate is not closed. There is no mention of closing the gate at the end of the night,~8 but in the morning of day 17, 40 minutes after sunrise the gate is opened again and the vigil ends (ba-a-a-at DUIJ-tir).229 Thus the only data that we have of bajjatu in the Hellenistic period are, from Uruk, for days 9-VII (TU 39) and 16-X(?) ('FU 41), and from Babylon for days 16-IX and 3-XI (CT 49, 150). Because we only have one day from the Neo-Babylonian period, day 17-IX from Uruk (UCP 9, 88, no. 23), there is obviously not enough information to reconstruct the monthly schedule of bajjatu-days, although days 9 and 16 may indicate a schedule of seven days intervals, similar to the above discussed bitpu-offerings.230 11.3.5. nubattu nubattu 'vigil, evening', but also 'evening ceremony, evening meal' is well known from the Neo-Assyrian period, especially in ritual texts and in the hemerological series inbu be! arbim ('Fruit(= epithet of the moon god Sin), lord of the month'). 231 As van Oriel noted,232 in the ritual texts nubattu was mostly used together with sertu 'morning', and should be translated 'evening meal' and 'morning meal'. In the inbu-series nubattu seems to refer to a ceremony which had to be performed on the evening before the day on which the essesu-ceremony was celebrated; attested days are 3, 7 and 16, dedicated to Marduk, followed by the essesu-ceremony on the days 4, 8 and 17 of the month, dedicated to Nabu. The Hellenistic period While from the Neo-Babylonian period examples of nubattu with the meaning 'evening ceremonies' are not known, in the Hellenistic rituals only one example is (perhaps) attested, in TU 40, obv. 10-11. The section, from which this passage is taken, describes 22s See 1.2. 226 The text is discussed more extensively in II.8.6.

II.3. Monthly ceremonies day 9 of the seventh month, Tasritu, during the second New Year festival in Uruk (see the Appendix): ' 10'fhe sheep, which since the evening (ceremonies?) (nu-bat-tu 4) [was tied(?) to] the gate of the [Grant(?)] Courtyard, 11its rites as for the eighth day ditto'. Whether nubattu has to be translated here 'evening ceremony/ies', or simple 'evening', 'vigil', is difficult to determine. It is, however, clear that no connection can be made with the data of the Neo-Assyrian texts, unless day 9 is an alternative day for day 8. Because we have no other examples from the Hellenistic period, it is not even certain whether TU 40, obv. 10-11 refers to a monthly ceremony, on this occasion performed during the New Year festival, or a special celebration, taking place only during the New Year festival. II.3.6. saliim b'fti The ceremony called saliim b'fti233 is best translated: 'the good-functioning (or com.pletion) of the temple' ceremony.234 I do not know of arguments which support the translation 'greeting of the temple' or 'early morning ceremonies', 235 and my trans.lation is based on the basic meaning of the verb saliimu 'to stay well, to be in good condition, intact'. Furthermore, in a ritual from Hellenistic Uruk, TU 39, rev. 5 and 8-9, an Akkadian lamentation incipit is recorded, which may support this interpretation, although the translation is difficult: Ei-sal-lim SILJMim.MA.AB(?) ¥ 'the temple will stay intact, keep it safe!'(?). The interpretation of the incipit is based on the idea, that the temple will not be destroyed, or that it will be restored, and must be kept safe and sound. This lamentation incipit appears to refer to the saliim b'fti-ceremony, hence my translation: 'the good-functioning of the temple'.236 The Neo-Babylonian period While we have only a few references to the ceremony in texts from the Neo-Assyrian period, 237 many data are available from texts of the Neo-Babylonian period. In his dissertation, Bongenaar has discussed the saliim b'fti-ceremony for Samas and other 233 Cf. F.Thureau-Dangin, RA 16 (1919), 132, n. 10; G. Furlani, Riti, 147; A.B.

that the ceremony 'seemingly was concerned with insuring the continued well-being of the temple'. 
235 CAD, S/1,202b. A.R. George, BIT, 222, n. 3, probably follows CAD since he states that the ceremony 
1is apparently an exuberant greeting of the city's temples in anticipation of the feast-day ahead'.

In texts from Neo-Babylonian Uruk and Babylon the ceremony is mentioned together with the bajjlitu-and essesu-ceremonies,245 and with the ginu-, guqqu-, niqe sarri-, and niqe karibi-offerings.246We already referred to the letter LASI, 280 where the connection between the essesu¥ and the salam bi"ti-ceremony is attested.247 The connection with 238 A.C.V.M.

II.4. Annual ceremonies these monthly-occurring cultic activities clearly shows that saliim b'fti is also a monthly ceremony. For the saliim bfti-ceremonies, flour,248 meat,249 vessels,2so and payments251 are attested. Because we only have a few data for the ceremony, it is not possible to say much about the schedule of the saliim b'fti-days in Neo-Babylonian Uruk and Babylon. It is interesting however, that of the five data that we have, four concern day 8, and that only months VII and IX are attested. GC 1, 203 from Uruk records day 8, but does not mention the month; YOS 6, 192 and 189 mention days 8-IX and 8-VII. VS 6,268 from Babylon mentions two saliim b'fti-ceremonies (ina 2 sa-lam E), one on day 8-VII and one on 5-VII, but the latter may well be a mistake for day 8. It is clear that the Sippar-schedule does not completely agree with our data: YOS 6, 192 (Uruk) and VS6, 268 (Babylon) mention month IX, which is not attested in the Sippar-texts, but the other days (8-VII in YOS 6, 189 and VS 6, 268) do agree with them. The Hellenistic period The saliim bfti-ceremony is attested only once in texts from the Hellenistic period; 252in TU 41, rev. 16, the sangu-priests and the temple enterers ( erib b'fti) perform the ceremony in the Res-temple of Anu in Uruk during the vigil preceding day 17 of (perhaps) the tenth month Tebetu 253(see the Appendix): ¥14 ¥.. The sangu-priests of the temples ofTiranna (and) secondly the temple enterers (erib bfn) of all the temples 15will kindle a fire from the torch and they will carry (it) to their temple. Then 16they will perform the the good-functioning of the temple ceremony (sti-lam E). They will kindle a brushwood pile at the gates of their temple' . ¥ Day 17-X is not attested in texts from Neo-Babylonian Uruk and Babylon. 11.4. Annual ceremonies The Babylonian year consisted of twelve months. However, because a lunar year of twelve months consists of 354 days, the lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year with 365.25 days. For this reason after c. 600 B.C. a series of second Ululus and second Addarus had to be added, that is seven months in every cycle of nineteen years.254 Based on the agricultural cycle, the year started around the time of the spring 248 GC 1, 12; 198; 203; A.B.

The most important and well-known annual ceremonies were celebrated during the New Year festival. However, there were more, of which we often know only very little. In this section the unspecified ceremonies, recorded in legal documents from Hellenistic Uruk concerned with prebend shares, will be discussed first, followed by the clothing ceremonies, the processions, and the divine marriage ceremonies. Then we will turn our attention to the New Year festivals ofUruk and Babylon, as known from texts from the Hellenistic period. Also, the brazier festivals will be discussed. Finally, all the collected data are brought together in two cultic calendars, one for Uruk, and one for Babylon. 11.4.1. Unspecified annual ceremonies259 Uruk While the monthly ceremonies are usually not dated, the annual ceremonies often were given an exact date by referring to the day and month on which they were performed; often the text specifically adds: sattussu 'every year, yearly'. In Hellenistic legal documents concerning prebend shares from Uruk a ceremony is recorded for Papsukkal on day 17 of Tasritu,260 a ceremony for Antu on day 8 of Addaru, and a ceremony for Belet-~eri on day 10 of Addaru. 255 The res satti (SAG MU.AN.NA) 'beginning of the year' was either the period between approximately 
15-XII and 15-1 (cf. E.F. Weidner, Handbuch, 82 f.), or, more likely, the 'New Year's day' (cf. S. Parpola, LAS 
II, 15 and 54). 
256 In the Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods day 1-1 fell approximately 14 days after the equinox (with 
variations of course), cf. H. Hunger, WZKM 67 (1975), 27. 
251 res satti could also refer to the seventh month, cf. E.F. Weidner, Handbuch, 83 and S. Parpola, LAS II, 
187. In ancient Israel a New Year in the first month Nisan and in the seventh month Tisri were also known, 
cf. A.J. Wensinck, Acta Or. I (1923), 168. A. Cavigneaux and F. Al-Rawi, Iraq 55 (1993), 96f. noted an 
interesting parallel between Babylonia and Israel: in Babylonia the writing of the tablets of fates for the whole 
coming year on day 7-VII is paralleled in Israel by the sealing of the destinies at the same time of the year, 
on Yorn Kippur. A Syrian text identifies Nisan as the 'beginning of the months' and Tisri as the 'beginning 
of the year', cf. S.P. Brock,JSS 30 (1985), 186. Also the Romans originally had two moments when the year 
began: the Idus of March and the Saturnalia in December, cf. H.S. Versnel, Triumphus. An inquiry into the 
origin, development and meaning of the Roman triumph, Leiden, 1970, 228. Note that the Akkadian name 
for the seventh month, Ta!iritu, means 'beginning', cf. W.G. Lambert, NABU 1989, no. 90.

The foodstuffs which are presented here consist of ox, fowl and lamb,262 ox, sheep, fowl, lamb and parched barley,263 or only fowl.264 Interestingly fowl is presented on these annual ceremonies, while it is not attested for the unspecified monthly ceremonies. 265 Several more ceremonies are known, the nature of which is often not clear. Because the data are all from calendar texts, we must assume that all ceremonies collected here were celebrated yearly:" Only a few are known from Uruk: five ceremonies on day 10 [ + x], 22, 26, 27 and 29 of the eleventh month Sabaµi are attested in the calendar text K 3753,266but because of the damaged state of the passage the context is difficult. Babylon Most of the ceremonies come from Babylon, and all are.attested in the calendar texts SBH VII// BRM 4, 25 and SBH VIII. However the relevant passages are often damaged, and the context of the attested ceremonies is in many cases difficult. Of the many references to ceremonies, often together with offerings, we will list here those which can form part of the cultic calendar.267 We will enumerate the ceremonies in a chronological order. A ceremony with Nabu in the (temple) garden on day 6 of the second month Ajjaru268 is known, followed by a ceremony of Nabu on day 7 of Ajjaru in the garden of Anu, situated in Emeurur, which is probably the temple of Nanaja at Babylon.269 261 Perhaps two more unspecified (annual?) ceremonies are recorded in OECT 9, 40, but the relevant passage is damaged; first a ceremony for Antu in the first month Nisannu (obv. 3d): 3. ina iliBAR [ ... ] 4.[ ... ] 1i!"Llu 1-enGESTIN1 iU-up-pe-ti¤d giJtal-lu ¤a An-tu,.

On day 18 of the eighth month Arabsamna a ceremony with offerings for Samas and others in various temples, including a procession and a ceremony with a brazier (kinunu) is recorded,272 and on day 25-VIII, a ceremony with offerings for Zababa of Kis and :furthermore for the city Isin and the temple Esabad, including a ceremony with the abgalgungunnu-d.rumand the kettledrum (lilissu).273 We also know of several ceremonies of the ninth month Kis1Imu, which all include

II.4.2. Annual clothing ceremonies While the data from the Neo-Babylonian and Hellenistic periods usually refer to the regularly celebrated monthly clothing ceremonies,292 there is some evidence from Hel.lenistic Uruk and Babylon that lubustu was also celebrated yearly on special occasions, as for example during the New Year festival, 2_93although due to lack of information the 'annual' character of the ceremony is not always certain. 1. Uruk We know of several clothing ceremonies from Uruk, which may have been celebrated only occasionally. 291 And neighbouring towns/cities, see A.R. George,BIT, 222, n. 4. 
292 For the monthly celebrated lubustu-ceremonysee II.3.3. 
291 Cf. GJ.P. McEwan,FAOS4,164. 
65 II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals The ritual text TU 39, describing the New Year festival of the seventh month Tasritu, refers to several gods being robed (nalbusu) on days 1 and 6 (obv. 1 and 6), and then records in a summarised version the clothing ceremonies (lubustu) of Anu, Antu and !star on the seventh day of the festival; the passage also mentions clothing ceremonies which are performed before the guqqu-offerings (obv.11-13): 'IIAs to the cella: the clothing ceremonies (tilg/u-bu-sa-at)of Anu and Antu and the clothing ceremonies oflstar. 12The setting in place of the ox. (Inside the room) between the curtains: songs by the singer and the lamentation priest. 13{The presentation of) guqqu-offerings which follow the clothing ceremonies (tilg/u-bu-us-tu4) and (the presentation of) the siltu.food (offerings). The consecration of the temple'. A clothing ceremony of Anu and Adad on day 3 of the sixth month Ululu is recorded in the calendar text K 3753. 294 Furthermore CLBT, pl. I contains, in obscure context, a reference to a clothing ceremony. 295 W 18728296does not contain clothing ceremonies but gives instructions for the clothing of various cultic functionaries, including several priests,297 and the king.298 The text probably deals with clothing instructions for a special festival, because of a reference to 'the second day' (ina 2-i u4-m[u ... ]),299so apparently refers to a festival lasting several days.300 No data are mentioned. Babylon From Babylon four clothing ceremonies are attested in the calendar text SBH VIII: a clothing ceremony of Marduk presumably on day 8 of the first month Nisannu, during the New Year festival,301 a clothing ceremony ofNabu for the divine marriage ceremony on the second day of the second month Ajjaru,302 a clothing ceremony perhaps of Marduk on day 3 of the ninth month Kis1Imu, 303and a clothing ceremony of an unknown god on day 16of Kislimu. 304 294 E.

with references to lubiiru-clothing and the kettledrum ( obv. 1 O'ff.)reminds us of the third version of the lunar

'from the opposite bank' (ultu alJula)on day 16 of an unlrnown month, but the context is not clear. 333 Finally, in an administrative document from the Arsacid period, BRM 1, 99,334 silver is paid for several groups of persons involved in a procession on day 1 of an unknown month: for the kurgarru-actors,assinnu-singerand songstresses, for the brewers(?), for two unknown groups of people, for the millers and for the Borsippaeans.

Divine marriage ceremonies The Mesopotamian divine marriage (LEQO~yciµo~, Akk. l:Jasiidu)was originally an hierogamy during which the king functions as a substitute for the god Tammuz (Dumuzi) and a priestess for the goddess !star (Inanna). 336 The ceremony is known from the Ur III period on, and it appears to be connected with the New Year festival.337In later texts the king has apparently lost his predominant position. In these texts the statues of a god and goddess were 'married'; they were brought together in a special bed-chamber for the divine marriage and for determining the destinies for the next year. The divine marriage is known from both Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon.338 The rites (par~u) of the divine marriage in connection with the New Year festival are attested in the Uruk text TU 39; the relevant passage is mentioned in a section dealing with the first day of the New Year festival of the month Tasrftu339: ' 4The rites of the divine marriage (par-~i.Mba-sa-du) 5will be performed 4in the Eb.ilikuga:: chapel, the bed-chamber of Eb,ilianna, 5the temple ofNanaja'. The bed-chamber (E.NIR) mentioned here is also attested in another Uruk ritual, TU 41, but a marriage does not take place there.340 The rites of the divine marriage (GARZA.GARZA ba-sa-du) are also attested in TU 38, in a list of offerings and ceremonies from Hellenistic Uruk. 341 Furthermore a wedding ceremony (badassutu) on day 3 of Ululu is recorded in the calendar text K 336 There is much debate about the origin and purpose of the divine marriage.

3753.342It is probably the wedding ceremony of Istar, because I, 9 specifically states that the whole month ofUliilu deals with lstar. Another Hellenistic reference to the divine marriage ceremony during the New Year festival, this time from Babylon, is recorded in SBH VIII; the relevant passage informs us that on day 11 of the New Year festival a wedding festival ('!Jadas.sutu),probably between Marduk and Zarpanitu, is celebrated.343 This text also refers to Nabfi as bridegroom in a wedding ceremony with Ninkali (?= Naniija?) in her temple Eursaba during day 2 of the month Ajjaru,344 Table XIV: marriage ceremonies from Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon date god(s) place Text 3-VI Istar Uruk K3753 I-VII -Uruk TU39 Uruk TU38 II-I Marduk, Zarpanitu(?)

The earliest reference dates from the Fara period, probably referring to an akitu-building or ceremony in Nippur,345 In the first millennium the New Year festival was celebrated twice a year, in the spring and in the autumn. The first forms more or less the beginning of the civil year, while the second opens the cultic year.346 The main purpose of the festival was for the ruler to be reaffirmed in his office by the gods, and for his people to be assured of another peaceful and prosperous year. During the festival this divine approval and assurance was celebrated by the whole community. The history of the New Year festival has been described extensively, most recently by Cohen and Pongratz-Leisten.347 In this paragraph an attempt is not made to present a complete new discussion of the festival, but rather an inventory of all the available sources from Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon is offered, in order to reconstruct the cultic calendar of the festival. 342 I, 19: x.A.BI [ ... ) is-sa[k-k]an ha-da-su-tu '[ ... ] the wedding ceremony will be perfonned'.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals II.4.5.1. Uruk From Hellenistic Uruk there is clear evidence for two New Year festivals, ináthe first month Nisannu and the seventh month Ta~ritu. We know some of the proceedings of these festivals, especially from BRM 4, 7, TU 39--40, KAR 132 and TU 43. The temple ritual texts describing the second New Year festival of the month Tasritu concentrate on the ritual activities in the Res-temple of Anu and Antu, and perhaps also in the Esgal.temple of !¤tar, because, as we already saw, we have a reference to a divine marriage ceremony taking place in the Ebilikuga, the bed-chamber of the Ebilianna, the temple of Nanaja. 348 In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods the temple ofNanaja was part of the Eanna complex, but as Falkenstein already noted,349 although during the Late Babylonian period !star and Nanaja moved from the old complex, Eanna, to the new, Esgal, it is not certain whether the temple-name Ebilianna passed to the new cella ofNanaja in the Esgal,350 or whether it remained to indicate Nanaja's sanctuary in Eanna. During the festival a procession to and from the akitu-temple took place. The ritual texts describing the first New Year festival in the month Nisannu concentrate on the ritual activities taking place before and during the procession to the akitu-temple, and the events in the akitu-temple. Several alatu-temples are attested from Hellenistic Uruk,351 Alatu.temples of Anu and !¤tar are mentioned in texts from Uruk concerning the itinnutu (office of building master)-prebend, 352 and the niirutu (singers) -prebend.353 The aki"tu-temples of Anu and Uruk are also often mentioned in the ritual texts, among which are a 'higher situated akitu-temple of Anu', and an 'alatu-temple (named) Bft ikribi' .354Falkenstein presumed that the Hellenistic buildings were at the same position as the Neo-and Late Babylonian sanctuaries.355An akftu-complex.was excavated during the twelfth excava.348 TU 39, obv. 4---5. See II.4.4. 349 Topographie,36, 41. 350 And not to the Res-temple (M.E. Cohen, Cultic Calendars, 329, n. 2 and 428, n. 2). 351 Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie,43-4. Several akftu-temples are also known from Neo-and Late Babylonian Uruk (cf. ib., 42-3): an akitu-ternple of Belet-sa-Uruk (YOS 7, 89, Cyr), an akitu-temple of U~ur-amassu (BIN 2, 31 // YOS 9, 74, and BM 113205, cf. J.A. Brinkman, WdO 5 [1969-70], 39ff., both Nabuna~ir; perhaps also: BIN 1, 170, Ner), and an akitu (-temple) of the open country (~eru) (AnOr 9, 2: 64, Asb.; 3: 44, Kand., cf. G. Frame, RA 76 [1982], 159). In texts from the Neo-Babylonian and later periods a special datepalm orchard ('garden~) is often mentioned, called hallatu.D. Cocqrerillat demonstrated that this is the garden which surrounded the akftu-temple (WdO 7 [1973], 96ff.; see also id., in: RIA 4 [1972], 60f.). This garden existed in several cities among which are Uruk and Babylon. In Uruk the garden is situated near the 'akitu (-temple) of the open country\ and offerings are presented in the temple of the 'Lady of the open country' (Belet-~eri) and other goddesses of Uruk (WdO 7 [1973], 106, 108, and 113 ff.; see also G.J.P.McEwan, FAOS4, 102f.). The garden of Babylon is called 'of Bel' (WdO 7 [1973], 131 f.; R. Zadok, 
RGTC 8 [1985], 147f.).

tion season. 356The large site with several temples confirms the assumption of Falkenstein 'daB die verschiedenen Festhiiuser nur Teile eines groBen Akitu-Komplexes sind' ,357 The second New Year festival (I'asr'itu) Of the two New Year festivals celebrated in Uruk, the festival of the seventh month Tasritu is best known. The festival lasted eleven days. BRM 4, 7 probably concerns the New Year festival ofTasritu. The colophon contains a catch-line, indicating that the text is part of a series of Uruk temple ritual texts.358 The text describes a program of the procession of Anu's statue during the New Year festival in Uruk, from his cella to the center of the Res-temple, and then going outside to the akftu-temple. Anu leaves the cella Enamenna (E.NAM.EN.NA 'House of Dominion') and arrives at the Grand Gate, and then the exorcistsá recite an incantation and the high priest, the exorcists, the other temple enterers (erib bitz), and the brewers, harnessed to the carrying pole, say a prayer. This is repeated during the seven stages of the procession until they J:iave reached the akftu-temple. 359 Falkenstein and Pongratz-Leisten have reconstructed this procession.36¡ The statue of Anu and the high priest departed from the Anu-cella (E.NAM.EN.NA Epapiiba) in the Res-temple, through the Grand Gate (KA.MAID, i.e. the NE gate of the Res.temple; then Anu was greeted by the high priest, the exorcists, the temple enterers and the brewers; the procession moved SE along the Street of the Gods (suqa ili:ini) until they reached the Pure Quay, wharf of the Boat of Anu, procession of the gods (KAR KU.GA arammu sa gi¤MA.AN.NAmiilak iliim); then NE along the Istar(?)-canal, to the upper wharf of the Pure Quay (arammu elu sa KAR KU.GA), still in the city area; then they disembarked, the procession moved through the district of the Adad-gate, the district of the lstar-gate, and the district of the Samas-gate, leaving the city through the Royal Gate (abul sarri), in the city wall, reaching finally (after crossing a branch of the Euphrates) the akftu-tempel B'it ikribi. During all these stages several incantations had to be recited.361 On what day did this procession talce place? To solve this problem we need to examine another text which deals with the New Year festival of Tasritu, TU 39-40. 362 In this 356 Cf. H.J. Lenzen, UVB 12/13 (1956), 35-42; J. Oelsner, Materialien, 87-8, with literature. 
357 Topographie, 44. 
358 For the colophon see also I.2. 
359 As we already noted (1.3), the brewers, mentioned after the erib bitis because they are not allowed to 
enter the temple, can join in as bearers of the carrying pole, because Anu has left the restricted temple area. 
In obv. 11, 15, 19, and 23 the text does not mention the brewers but refers to them indirectly by saying: 'the 
bearers of the carrying pole'. For this carrying pole see my comments on TU 39, obv. 19, in the Appendix. 
360 A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 45 ff.; B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi irub, 42f. 
361 Similarto Anu in Uruk also Marduk in Babylon has to pass through seven stages during the procession 
to the akitu-temple, see B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina su/mi irub, 40f. Evidence for this procession comes from 
other texts, one of which is the Ashurbanipal tablet K 9876 + (latest discussion by B. Pongratz-Leisten, 
ina su/mi irub, 228-32, no. 8). Similar to BRM 4, 7 this text from Babylon also contains instructions for 
the recitations which have to be recited during the seven stages of the procession of Marduk (Bel) to the 
alcitu-temple. Especially on the obverse the songs of the !star-priests appear to be important. 
362 And not for the month Nisannu (A.K. Grayson, Chronicles, 278 and S. Sherwin-White, JHS 103 [1983], 
159, n. 40), see TU 39, obv. 1. 
II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals text almost all of the eleven days of the festival of Tasritu are preserved. Crucial is the interpretation of TU 39, obv. 1-15, describing days 1, 6 and 7. Cohen argued that the. procession to the akztu-temple took place on the first day, after which during the first seven days of the festival Anu resided in the akztu-temple.363 The two chariots of Anu transported all sorts of ritual goods to the akztu-temple during those seven days.364Anu probably remained at the akztu-temple during this period, since neither Anu nor any other gods are mentioned going to the akztu-temple. Then, Cohen argues, at the end of day 7 the great procession from the akztu~temple to the Res-temple inside the city walls took place-365 However, another interpretation of TU 39, obv. 1-15 is possible, which agrees more with the events described on days 8-11. After Enlil, Ea and the other gods are robed (for the procession on day 8), a silver chariot of Anu and a golden chariot of Anu (but not Anu himself) go to the akztu-temple every day until day 8, apparently to bring all sorts of ritual goods for the ceremony. After a divine marriage ceremony on day 1, four more gods are robed on day 6 (for the procession on day 8). On day 7 more preparations follow: after the awakening of the temple ceremony (dfk bfti), food and drinks are prepared, 366and then, after the other gods are all robed for the procession, it is Anu's, Antu's and !star's turn.367 The room between the curtains (birft siddt) in front of the Anu-cella (Enamenna), the first station which Anu will pass on day 8 on his way to the akztu-temple, 368is made ready, followed by offerings and the consecration of the temple. 369Then probably a reference is made to preparations on the route of the procession, referred to in the text as 'the street processional way, the procession-ships and the akztu-temple' .37¡Finally, as on every cultic day, on day 7 the morning and evening meals are also served and cleared away. For the scribe of TU 39-40 the first seven days are of less importance than what follows on the next days, which are described extensively. Probably there is no need to describe them in detail, because they are the same as the first seven days of the Nisannu version; indeed it is specifically stated that the ceremonies of day 7 of Tasrltu are the same as those of day 7 ofNisannu,371 The very abbreviated form in which the events are described also points in this direction. Anu is not mentioned, apart from a short reference to the cella, where clothing ceremonies of Anu, Antu, and !star are performed; 372 as we would expect, at this time Anu is apparently still in his cella in the Res-temple. Only on day 8 does Anu appear in the foreground as the leading figure of the procession. 373 All the gods come down from their seats and gather in the Grand Courtyard in the Res-temple facing Anu. Here the procession of Anu to the akztu-temple begins, but we are not able to follow the route taken, because the end of day 8 and the beginning 363 Cu/tic Calendars, 428; see also 329-30 and 405.

of day 9 are lost. Still on day 8 the gods and the cultic objects take their seats in the Grand Courtyard, in front of Anu. The king and the people are sprinkled with water, a meal áis served and libations performed, after which Anu enters the room between the curtains, accompanied by Papsukkal, the exorcists and a temple enterer (erib hfti), who carries the Scepter ofKingship.3 74A priest performs several offerings and libations and the king and people are sprinkled again. Then the text breaks off. The description of the procession to the akftu-temple must have followed here, and then the journey back to the Res-temple, either on day 8, or at the latest on day 9, since TU 40 already mentions several stations which had to be passed on the way back.375 On day 9,376 after a hand-raising prayer is recited,377 the king performs a libation and then Anu enters the Grand Gate (KA.MAU) and sits on the Dais of Destinies (parak sfmatt).378The same rites as on day 8 are performed, after which Anu enters the room between the curtains 379and all the gods gather around him. The same ofilrings and libations as those of day 8 are performed. Then Anu leaves the room between the curtains and sits upon the Dais of Kingship (parak sarruti)380 in his cella, surrounded by the other gods, after which the king performes a libation, and enters Ubsukkinaku. The following passage is damaged. The reverse of TU 39 describes the final events of day 9, and the events on day 10 and 11. A liver is placed on the Dais of Anu. The diviner and the sangu-priestof Adad take the liver. The main and second meal are served. A lamentation is recited. Since this is a special occasion the gate is not closed, as was common on normal cultic days. In the evening the last meal is cleared and the main and second meal of the evening are served, after which the same lamentation is recited again. The vigil continues the whole night and the gate is closed at the end of the night, before the beginning of day 10. On the 10th day381 at night, in Ubsukkinaku the awakening of the temple ceremony is performed by means of the lamentations ANA ELUME 'The honored one ofHeaven 1382 and UMUN SERMAL ANKIA 'Lord, respected one of Heaven and Earth\. 383At dawn the gate is opened and the vigil ended. During the day the two main and second meals are served and in the evening the gate is closed. On the 11th day384the awakening of the temple ceremony is also celebrated by means of the lamentations AME AMASANA 'The bull in his fold' 385and ELUM DIDARA 'The honored one who wanders about' ,386at night in Ubsukkinaku. At dawn the gate is opened and several gods gather around Anu in the Grand Courtyard. They sit upon their 374 Obv. 29.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals seats and wait for Lugalbanda and Ninsun. The main meal of the morning is served. As soon as Lugalbanda and Ninsun have arrived the main meal is cleared and a priest performs a libation with a golden libation bowl for Lugalbanda and Ninsun and all the other gods. Then the main and second meal of the last double hour of the day take place in the usual manner. The text ends with a colophon, with the catch-line: 'The (eighth) month Ara.lJsamna,; day 5: Misaru will rise from Ebenunna, the temple of Adad and (will come here)', 387 which shows that TU 39-40 is part of a series of temple ritual texts covering the whole year. What is striking is that, although the king clearly participates in the ritual activities, 388 he is only one of the participants, especially in the procession leading Anu back from the akftu-temple on day 9,389 This appears to be different in the Nisannu version. The first New Year festival (Nisannu) KAR 132 deals with the New Year festival of the first month Nisannu, and contains an elaborate description of the ceremonies which took place shortly before the procession to the akftu-temple, and also describes the beginning of the ceremonies at the akftu-temple. In the beginning of the text Anu has already left his cella and taken up position in the Grand Courtyard,390 A number of gods enter the Grand Courtyard. Then Enlil and Ea enter this courtyard, 391 while several of the other gods take up position at the left side of the gate of the cella ( of Antu?). Next, the king follows these gods to the cella of Antu, joined by several goddesses. In the presence of the exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers, the linen curtain and the golden libation bowl, Antu is escorted from the cella to the Grand Courtyard. 392 After this the king, together with the exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers, the linen curtain and the golden libation bowl, and with Nanaja and several other goddesses, goes to the temple Urugal and leads !star to the Grand Courtyard.393 Col. II and III up to I. 17 describe the putting in position of the other gods, cultic objects and priests. In col. III, 21 Anu is led from the Dais ofDestinies in Ubsukkinaku by Papsukkal, Nusku, Usmil and the king, followed by the other gods. Probably, therefore, in the broken passage (after the end of col. II) the procession of Anu from the Grand Courtyard to the Dais of Destinies is described, which could take place only after the arrival of Antu and !star in the Grand Courtyard. Next, the whole assembly proceeds and, with Anu up front, enters the akftu-temple and takes it seats.394Anu takes up position on the Great Dais in the courtyard of the 387 TU 39, rev. 26.

akftu-temple, followed by the other gods. Papsukkal and the king then lead Anu from the Great Dais to his cella. Again, the other gods follow. The carrying poles of Anu and the other gods are brought in, a hand-raising prayer is recited by the lamentation priest,395 and more gods enter the cella. After this the text breaks off. The text concentrates on the akftu-procession, and does not describe the days before and after this procession. It is more than probable, however, that KAR 132 is only one of a series of tablets describing all the days of the festival in Nisannu; because the beginning and end of the text are damaged, any reference to these tablets has been lost. The text gives more details on the beginning of the procession, by carefully recording all the deities and cult objects involved in the festival. While the cultic events in the akftu-temple are not mentioned in the Tasntu version, here a detailed description of what took place at the akftu-temple is presented. Furthermore, apart from Anu and Antu, !star plays an important role, and more other gods are also mentioned here than in the Tasntu version. Finally, as we saw, the king has a leading part in tl:ie procession; he plays a more prominant role in the Nisannu version of the festival, than in the Tasntu version, which is not surprising since the New Year festival ofNisannu coincides with the beginning of the civil year, the month Nisannu being the coronation month of the king. More evidence for the New Year festival of Nisannu comes from TU 43. The main part of the text contains a suillakku-(hand-raising) prayer, which has to be recited on the tenth day of the New Year festival to Anu (obv. 1-20, rev. 1-16). See rev. 17: ' 17Hand-raising prayer of Anu, which [they will recite] in the (first) month Nisannu, day 10, to A[nu]'. It also records a suillakku-prayerto be recited on the eleventh day: ' 18The (first) month Nisannu, day 11, when Anu [sits] on the Dais of Anu, on the Dais [of Kingship(?)], 19[the la]mentation priest will stand and 20[will recite] the hand-raising prayer 19'Strong Anu, revered by [himself(?)], 20who [alo]ne is Lord 19[in Heaven and on Earth'], 2oto the accompaniment of a lyr[e]~.396 The text does not inform us where the suillakku-prayeron day IO is recited, but for the prayer on day 11 we are back in the cella of Anu (Enamenna), in the Res-complex, because the text mentions the Dais of Anu (parak Ani), 391 and (probably) the Dais of kingship .. The number of days on which the events described in KAR 132 took place is not preserved. If the New Year festival of the first month paralleled that of the seventh 395 IY,23: ANGALE 10, Great Anu'. 
396 This hand-raising prayer was also recited on the ninth day ofTdritu during the Uruk New Year festival

18ff. month then alJ the events described would have taken place on day 8 and 9, as in the Tasrltu version. An indication that the Nisannu version is at least partly similar to the Tasritu-version is found in TU 39, where at the end of the passage describing day 7, it is noted that the ceremonies, described only briefly, are the same as on day 7 ofNisannu.398 Furthermore, the description of day 11 of Nisannu in TU 43 outlines activities in the Res-temple, and no reference is made to the akftu-temple, nor to the procession, which may indicate that the procession did not return to the Res-temple on day 11 of Nisannu (as is the case in the Nisannu version in Babylon, see below), but on day 9, as in the Tasr'itu version of Uruk. However, as Cohen noted, because the Nisannu festival celebrates the beginning of the civil year, while the Tasrltu festival opens the cultic year, this may have (partly) altered the nature of the festival.399 An indication that this may be the case may be found in a building inscription from Hellenistic Uruk, YOS 1, 52 (68 S.E.), which refers to day 8 of Nisannu, although there is no mention of the New Year festival: the building of the Res-temple is completed, Anu and Antu enter the temple to dwell for ever in the Anu-cella Enamenna, and the regular offerings are perfonned.400 The entering of Anu in his celJa on day 8 ofNisannu, presumably during the New Year festival,401 does not fit the Tasrltu version, where Anu leaves his cella on day 8 and returns on day 9 from the akftu-temple,402 However, although differences may have existed between the Nisannu and the Tasrltu versions, in general probably a very similar schedule was used. II.4.5.2. Babylon Two New Year festivals were also celebrated in Babylon, one during the first month Nisannu, and one during the seventh month Tasrltu. 398 Obv. 15. 399 M.E. Cohen, Cullie Calendars, 433-4. 400 Lines 16-18. 401 Apparently the celebration of the restored Res-temple coincides with the New Year festival, since it is hardly conceivable that on this occassion the New Year festival did not take place (from chronicle texts we know that only at a time of a serious crisis was the festival not celebrated; see for example the Nabonidus chronicle, cf. A.K. Grayson, Chronicles,no. 7, JI, 5 f.; 10 f.; 19f.; see also Ill, 8). However, does the entering of Anu on day 8-1 in the Res-temple, attested in the building inscription, perhaps indicate that, because of the special festivities, the New Year festival celebrated in year 68 S.E. did not follow the usual order of cultic events? 402 The inauguration of temples in the month Nisannu is only indicated by the Hellenistic Uruk building inscriptionsYOS 1, 52 and J. Jordan, Uruk-Warka.WVDOG 51, Leipzig, 1928, pl. 108, c, with 41 (2-1-110 [ +?] S.E.). In the series iqquripus (defining certain months as favorable or unfavorable for particular activities) the month Nisannu is favorable for, amongst other things, building a temple, renovating a sanctuary, and for organizing an akftu, cf. R. Labat, Calendrier,92, ¤32, 1 (cf. 228, 12), but this is also favorable in some other months. The later months III and V were more appropriate for the building of temples, cf. R.S. Ellis, Foundation Deposits in Ancient Mesopotamia, New Haven and London, 1968, 17 ff. Note that Sennacherib inaugurated a temple in ijuzurlna (Sultantepe) on day 8 of the seventh month Tasntu, cf. J.N. Postgate, Royal Grants,78, no. 40, obv. 9'. Although in Israel the temple of Salomo was also inaugurated in the seventh month Ethanim (1 Kings, 8, 2; cf. 2 Chron., 5, 3), the festival for the inauguration of the temple in Jerusalem (Chanukkah) is celebrated on day 25 of the ninth month Kislev. The second New Year festival {Tasrftu) For the second New Year festival of the seventh month Ta~ritu no evidence has been preserved from the Hellenistic period, 403 with the exception perhaps of a short reference to a clothing ceremony of Bel on day 7 of Tasrltu(?), and a reference to the arranging of the alu-drum (for the procession to the akitu-temple?) on day 8 of Tasrltu in BM 32206 +.404This may be explained partly by the fact that ritual texts from Hellenistic Babylon are rare, and furthermore because the second festival opened the cultic year, not the civil year, and therefore no references to this festival would have been made in non-cultic sources such as chronicles and astronomical diaries, unless something unusual had happened. In the astronomical diaries no clear references are made to the New Year festival or the akitu-temple for the month Tasrltu. Note however that diary no. -132 describes political and religious upheavels during the 7th month Tasritu: in the midst of political turmoil and war(threat) it is stated that ''the god Bel has entered Babylon" (B, rev. 27). Men and women place offerings on a dais and celebrate opposite it. On the 11th Nanajaá appears: "Nanaja has entered Ezida in Borsippa" (B, rev. 31, similar during the 6th month Ulfilu, cf. B, obv. 29). In Borsippa(?) more celebrations and cultic events seem to follow, Nanaja is mentioned in connection with a headband(?) and a chariot; the assembly (kinistu) appears. Apparently the people of Babylon and Borsippa are advised to resist plundering and (importantly) not to hand over the gods as booty to the enemy in order to save the city (Left edge, 2). Because the historical passages are very damaged and far from understandable, we do not know if they bear any relation to the New Year festival. However, although the tablet still needs to be studied in depth, it is already very clear from diary no. -132 that Babylonian religion and cult were very much alive as late as 133 B.C.405 It is remarkable that a "sailor whose mind was deranged" invited the population to participate in the festivals and that they, "men and women" enthusiastically did so, and "enjoyed themselves". The first New Year festival (Nisannu) There is more evidence for the New Year festival of the first month Nisannu, both from cultic and non-cultic sources, from Hellenistic Babylon. We do not have much evidence for day 1 ofNisannu, the first day of the festival. There is a small (Late Babylonian?) fragment discussed by Cagirgan. 406 Although damaged, some of the events are clear: on the first ofNisannu at dawn an arranger of the offering table (mubannu)401 enters the courtyard of Bel with a key (namzaqu);a house (or temple) and water are mentioned. 403 Pre-Hellenistic evidence for the New Year festival in Babylon during the month Tasritu is also rare. 
Important is ABL 956 (LAS 190). Cf. S. Parpola, LAS II, 186-87; M.E. Cohen, Cu/tic Calendars, 328-9, 
and 451. However, according to F. Reynolds (Bi0r 53 [1996], 92) the evidence for this festival has been 
overestimated.

on day 7 ofTasn"lu (TU 39, obv. 11, see also 13).

Then the arranger goes to the Grand Gate with the key, opens the gate of the well and throws the key(?) into the water of the well(?). The function of the ceremony is not clear. There is also, in a list of temple expenditures, a reference to meat for regular offerings on day 1 ofNisannu.408 Several ritual texts, which contain parts of tablets 22 and 23 of the ritual series concerning the New Year festival of the month Nisannu (DT 15 +) were published by F.Thureau-Dangin. 409It is our most important source for the public cult of Marduk (here called Bel) in Hellenistic Babylon. The text concentrates especially on the prayers which accompanied the cultic actions. The ritual instructions for the first day ofNisannu are lost. For the second to the fifth day we have several large fragments. The text contains a short reference to the sixth day, incorporated in the description of the third day, but the seventh to the eleventh days are lost. The first cul tic events are for all four days the same. The description of each day begins with a reference to the exact double hour of the night, 410on which a high priest rises and washes himself with river water. 411Then he approaches Bel and his spouse Beltija (i.e. Zarpanitu) and removes the curtain in front of them. 412 After these introductory lines one or more (for each day different) prayers are always recited, followed by the opening of the gate ceremony (pft biibi).413On each day, so the text records, the temple enterers ( erib bfti) also enter the cella and 'perform their rites as usual' (ME-su-nu GIM sagi-na-a DU.MES), as do the lamentation priests and singers. 414 After these standard procedures the different cultic events of each day are presented. For day 2 after a prayer to Bel4I5 and the pft biibi-ceremony only a small part of a ceremony is preserved.416 For day 3 we know a little more. The prayer to Bel is almost completely lost.417After the third hour of the morning the high priest calls in three craftsmen, a metalworker, a carpenter and a goldsmith, and gives them materials to make two figurines. They have to work on these figurines from day 3 to day 6. The payments for these craftsmen is also mentioned. 418 In the next section the shape of these figurines is described.419 They are kept in the temple of Madanu and in E!}ursagtila, the temple of Ninurta in Babylon until day 6, and are used in a ceremony involving Nabu on day 6, which leads to their destruction, but the exact turn of events is not clear because the passage is partly damaged. 420 408 AB 244, rev. 30, U.E. 31 (G.J.P.

420 M. Stol made the following suggestion to me: both figurines lift up their right hand against (ana) Nabu, 
On day4 a hand-raising prayer (suillakku) for Bel,421 and also a prayer for Beltija are recitedby the high priest.422 The actual festival begins when the high priest pronounces praise three times with the words 'ilru-star (Pegasus), Esagila, image of Heaven and Earth' ,423 Then, after the second meal in the late afternoon, Eniima elis.is recited or enacted by the high priest424 to Bel, and apparently this took the rest of the day, because no other cultic events are recorded.425 The text does not describe the procession of the king on the fourth day from his palace to the temple ofNabft, near the palace, where the scepter was offered to him and the fate of the king was decreed, except in the prayers recited during this day.426 Also no mention is made of the king's journey to Borsippa, to bring the statue ofNabu back to Babylon the next day.427 On day 5 prayers for Bel and for Beltija are recited.428 Then the king enters Babylon with Nabu, but before he goes into Esagila the text describes extensively how Esagila, including the cella of Bel and the cella ofNabu (Ezida), are prepared for this visit by the high priest.429-During these preparations the high priest goes out to the open country, leaving an exorcist ~nd a slaughterer to purify the temple with the carcass of a sheep.430 one holding a snake, the other a scorpion. Apparently they represent enemies ofNab1l, the son of Marduk. Leftovers of the offering table of Madanu are served to them, which suggests that they are in a prison with bad food. Then they are apparently burned. Here perhaps a myth concerning Nab1l is expressed, in which he defeats two opponents. Indeed Nabfi is known as a savior, and as the one who reaps glory for his father Marduk (cf. F. Pomponio,Nabu, Roma, 1978, 122 and W.G. Lambert, in: Matoui Festschrift II, 95 sub B 12). It is also possible that the figurines symbolize the exorcist and the slaughterer, who purify the temple on day 5 (cf. J.A. Black, Religion 11 (1981], 55). 421 Lines 222 ff. A hand-raising prayer is a personal prayer, here illustrated by the fact that the priest refers to himself in the prayer (!. 245). Also, in this prayer the power of Marduk and his mercy for the city and its people is described. 422 Lines 251 ff. Note that some of the epithets ofZarpanitu are parallel to those of Marduk in the preceding prayer Oines 223-251; 240-254; 245-262). First Zarpanitu is described as the most brilliant of the stars (252), probably refering to the planet Venus (see 325). Then the prayer describes Zarpanitu as protector of the poor, the captive, the fallen, the king, the citizens of Babylon, but also for the servant, that is the high priest who performs the prayer and who addresses himself in the third person (note that in his prayer to Marduk he did not dare to pray for himself). 423 Line 274. Cf. K. van der Toom, Suppl. VT 43 (1991), 332, with n. 7. 424 See my comments on line 282 in the Appendix. 425 From BM 32206 +, II, 62-64, we know that the Eniimaeli! was also recited on day 4 of the ninth month Kislimu in Babylon, which may indicate that it was recited on the fourth of every month. If this is true then obviously there is no special connection of the Epic of Creation with the New Year festival as W.G. Lambert suggested(JSS13 [1968], l07); we would then have to re-examine the function of Eniimaelis in this festival, which could alter our present ideas of the festival all together. 426 Lines 244 ff. 421 Cf. K. van der Toorn, Suppl. VT 43 (1991), 332-3, with n. 8-10. 428 Lines 288 ff. and 317 ff. In these prayers Marduk's power and Zarpanitu's protective role (see 326) again are important. Marduk is called 'Dimmerankia, who decrees the destinies' (301) and ZarpanYtu is identified with 'Damkianna, lady of Heaven and Earth' (324), wife ofEnki-Ea and mother of Marduk in Eniima elis. Then the names of planets and stars are mentioned, with whom the two deities have to be identified. Note that Marduk is connected with the male heavenly bodies and Zarparu-iu with the female heavenly bodies. At the end of the prayer to Marduk sun and moon are mentioned (314-5), perhaps to be identified with Marduk, similar to Venus who must be identified with Zarpanitu (see above). Note that the Sumerian ideograms used are explained by their Akkadian epitheta, cf. M. Stol, NABU 1989, no. 60. 429 Lines 338 ff. 430 Also incantations (!iptu) of the type 'The house is conjured' are recited by the exorcist. We have evidence from the astronomical diaries that during the month Nisannu and A,ijaru in Babylon incantations are recited, see A.J. Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries, no. -226, A, obv. 41 and 231 (85 S.E.)., in the latter case in connection with the kettledrum, see II.5.2. Afterwards the carcass is thrown into the river and they leave for the open country themselves, not to return as long as Nabii is in Babylon, that is, as long as the New Year festival lasts, until day 12. Clearly their presence would disturb the ceremony since they might endanger the purification process.431 After the temple is consecrated, during the morning the high priest and the craftsmen bring out the golden canopy from the treasury of Marduk and cover Ezida, the cella of Nabu in Esagila, and utter a cry of distress (ikkillu).432 After the craftsmen have left an offering table is set up in front of Bel, after which a prayer is recited.433 The offering table is brought to Nabii (preswnably in Borsippa),á after which he travels to Esagila by ship, probably accompanied by the king, although the ( damaged) text does not say this.434 Then the king enters the scene. His hands are washed and he is led into Esagila, where he has to take part in a special ceremony.435 The high priest takes away scepter, loop, mace, and the Crown of Kingship and places them upon a seat in front of Bel in his cella. Then he goes out and strikes the king's cheek, leads him into the cella in front of Bel, pulls him by his ears and makes him kneel down on the ground. The slap on the cheek is an accusation, and the king replies by saying that he has not neglected the gods, the city of Babylon, the temple Esagila, nor his subjects.436 After a break in the text, during which the king leaves the cella again, the high priest assures the king that Bel will magnify his lordship, extol his kingship, and destroy his enemies. The king rediscovers his dignity and the high priest brings out scepter, loop; mace and crown from the cella and returns them to the king, after which he strikes the king's cheek again: if tears fl.ow, Bel is satisfied, if not, Bel is angry and he will bring about the king's downfall.437 431 McEwan has interpreted this passage as referring to separate a/cftu-festivals outside Babylon: a/cftuina ~eri (FAOS 4, 179 and 180, n. 419), since day 6-11, attested in Uruk (TU 39--40), are not attested in Babylon: But see SBH VIII, II, 1-11 (discussed below), which probably describes events on day 8 and 11 ofNisannu in the akftu-temple. Furthermore, the Babylon text does not actually mention an akftu-ceremony 'in the open country'. As we already saw we have some Neo-Babylonian references to a-lei-.(!) ¤aEDEN (AnOr 9, 2, 64; see also 3, 44) but here clearly the akitu (-temple) of the open country is intended, and not a/cftu-festivals outside Babylon. Also, there is no need for such an interpretation: as long as Nabft is in Babylon, the exorcist and the slaughterer, who have performed the purification with the carcass of a sheep and apparently are unclean, are not allowed to be in Babylon, so that their 'unclean' presence may not bring into danger the divine rites. For the same reason the high priest may not observe this purification, because ifhe does, he is not pure (lines 364-5). Compare this with KAR 60, describing the Neo-Assyrian Assur-version of the kettledrum ritual (obv. 15-18, rev. 1-4), where the lamentation priest had to uncover his head and bow down (a typical . position of penitence), necessary because the priest was responsible for a crime: the killing of the bull, a 
sacred animal, which makes him unclean. Also he has to decline three times the responsibility for killing the 
. animal. Furthermore, apparently the lamentation priests wereallowed to eat the meat, but not the chief singer 
of dirges (galamiibu), because he was considered responsible for killing the bull. See II.5.2. 432 Lines 366 ff. 433 Lines384 ff. Here Marduk is addressed as the god of the akitu-festival, and perhaps a reference is made to the procession to the akitu-temple named Bit ikribi (400-1), which has to follow on day 8 (not described in this text). 434 Lines 403ff. 435 Lines 413 ff. 436 Cf.K..van derToorn, Suppl. VT 43 (1991), 333. 437 Lines434 ff. II.4. Annual ceremonies After a ceremony with a reed bundle and the divine bull, the function of which is not clear,438 the text ends.439 More information on the events from day 8 on comes from other sources.440 Before discussing the Hellenistic textual evidence, firstbriefly the events on days 8-11: on day 8441 the procession of the king, ¥taking Bel by the hand', together with Nabu and all the other gods, who had gathered in Esagila, moved from Esagila to the akftu-temple situated 'in the open country' (ina ~eri). We are not well informed about the events taking place in the akftu-temple. The procession returned on day 11, probably by the same route, back to Esagila, passing through several stations, among which the Dais of Destinies (parak simiiti), where Bel determined the destinies for the next year.442This was one of the highlights of the festival. New textual evidence from the Hellenistic period has come available. We now have a Hel.lenistic fragment of a temple ritual, BM 41577, which may deal with the month Nisannu, and presents us with new evidence for the New Year festival in Babylon.443 The main pro.ceedings described in this fragment consist of a visit of the high priest to the cella of Bel, where he recites a Sumerian blessing to Bel. Then he enters the cella of Beltija, to recite another Sumerian blessing. He returns to Bel and recites a blessing, this time in Akka.dian, after which he enters the cella ofBeltija again for another blessing also in Akkadian. The fragment probably deals with day 6 or 7 of Nisannu, as George suggested, 444 and the cultic activities must have preceded the procession to the akftu-temple on day 8. 438 Lines 453 ff. In line 458 a reference is made to the slaughtering(??) of a white bull, after which a blessing to the divine bull follows. Lines 463-71 are now partly available in BM 32485 (published in this study, see Plate I), but do not help to explain the ceremony because of the damaged state of the fragment. The bull and the king are mentioned several times and perhaps a thigh-piece of the bull is consumed. According to Thureau-Dangin (RAcc., 146, n. 1) this slaughtering(??) of the white bull symbolizes the beginning of the New Year, quoting Virgil (Georg. I, 217): 'with his gilded horns the white bull opens the year'. At the time when the ritual took place in the spring the sun would still be in the zodiacal sign of the Bull. Note that the ceremony took place after sunset, and if the bull indeed has astral meaning, we might haveto think in terms of the rising of constellations before sunrise or after sunset, cf. W Hartner, JNES 24 ( 1965), 1 ff., especially 5 ff. 439 For the Jines 472 ff. see my comments in the Appendix. 440 Cf. K. van der Toom, Suppl. VT 43 (1991), 333f. and M.E. Cohen, Cu/tic Calendars, 438ff. with the relevant textual evidence. The procession is extensively described by B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi lrub, 40f. See also the Neo-Babylonian fragments VS 24, 108(+) 109 // 110 (ina sulmifrub, 236-39, nos. 10-11), which deal with Marduk's stay in the akftu-temple. 441 See K. van der Toom, Suppl. VT 43 (1991), 336, with n. 28, contra P.-R. Berger, in: CRRA 17 (1970), 156, who suggested that the procession left on day 9 ofNisannu. 442 The place where the destinies are determined, the Dais of Destinies, is sometimes called the DU6,KU the 'Pure Mound', originally the cosmic seat of the king of the gods of Heaven and Earth (Lugaldimmerankia) in the divine assembly, see for example BRM 4, 7, rev. 37 (see my comments on this line in the Appendix). In Babylon it is the seat of Marduk/Bel as Lugaldimmerankia in Ubsukkinaku ofEsagila ( cf. A.R. George, House Most High, no. 180). In our text the passage with the Dais of Destinies is missing, but on day 5 Marduk is called d0iM.ME.ER.AN.KI.A mu-simNAM.MES '(Lugal)dimmerankia, who decrees the destinies' ,(RAcc., 137, 301). Note that the second New Year month TMrTtu in the Nippur calendar is failed DU6,KU(.GA), the beginning of the religious year when the destinies were determined in the DU6,KU (cf. B. Landsberger, Kult. Ka/ender, 34; A. Tsukimoto, Untersuchungen zur Totenpffege, Kevelaer, 1985, 204). Also in Uruk the seventh month Tasntu is called DU6.KU, see the New Year text TU 39, obv. 1 and rev. 25. 443 A.R. George, Studies W.G. Lambert, no. I, 260 ff. 444 ib., 263. II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals Day 8 day of the New Year festival of Nisannu is not discussed in the Babylon text RAcc., 127ff., but we do have other references to this day in texts from Hellenistic Babylon. First there is the chronicle 13b.445 The text describes food offerings for Bel and Beltija in Esagila on day 8 ofNisannu in year 88(?) S.E. These offerings are made by the administrator (satammu)ofEsagila, according to the command of the king. There are many problems with this text, which will be dealt with elsewhere. 446Important here is that, although the king himself is not present during these offerings, Bel and Beltija are still in Esagila on day 8 of Nisannu, which must mean that these activities took place just before the procession began. Strong evidence for this procession on day 8 ofNisannu comes from an astronomical diary, a fragment from the reign of Antiochus III (107 S.E.)447: 14 ... [ITI].BI UD.8.KAM 1An LUGALu r1ux1 15 [TAJ E.GAL E-ni a-na KASIKIL.[LAsa E].SAG.GiLl,a-ru-u sa MU rx, 116 [a-n]a?E.SAG.GiLina IGI.MES-su-nu DU-usN[IDBA?Jra-na11dJAMAR.UTUK.AR1 rx, 17 [ ... ] rx, sa li-pi-su-nu GAR-nu ...

The beginning of the second column (and a large part of the first column?) deals with the New Year festival during the month Nisannu: a clothing ceremony (of Marduk) is mentioned probably for day 8, since the text continues with a procession to the akftu.temple Bft ikribi.451On day 11 a festival (isinnu)452is celebrated in the akftu-temple, 44s BM 35421, published by A.K. Grayson,Chronicles, 283f. and pl. XI (collated).

4s2 Different names for the festival (isinnu) of akitu are known, especially in royal inscriptions. Sanherib 
for which presents and gifts are brought in, and which includes a wedding festival (badassiitu), perhaps between Marduk and Zarpanitu.453 The recently published Late Babylonian, possibly Hellenistic fragment BM 4 7902 +, originally consisting of four columns, deals with events taking place in the akitu-temple Bft ikribi during the Nisannu New Year fesival in Babylon.454 Obverse I describes Bel and the other gods taking up position in the akitu-temple. Part of column IV is duplicated by K 9876 +, which describes recitations which had to be performed during the festival, similar to the Uruk text BRM 4, 7.455BM 47902 + also mentions the twelfth day 'when Bel rises' (tebu, obv. I, 20), which probably refers to events taking place in Esagila after Bel had returned from the akitu-temple. 456 More indirect evidence for the eleventh day comes from non-cultic sources. An astronomical diary may suggest that king Antiochus II Theos (together with his three sons) was in Esagila on day 11 of Nisannu (66 S.E.), perhaps returning from the akftu temple on the last day of the festival.457 Also, in the already mentioned list of temple speaks of a 1festival of the banquet (i-sin-ni qe-re-tz) of Assur\ 0/P 2, 143, 8-9, see also 136, 25 (cf. B. Menzel, Tempel I, 55 with II, 53", n. 659, cf. also I, 23 with II, 21 ', n. 239). Assurbanip_al mentions a lfestival of joy 1 (isinnu !Jidiiti), R.C. Thompson, Esarh., pl. 18, VI, 11 (i-[sin-n]i !JUL.MES). Neriglissar speaks ofa 1festival of akrtu' (i-na i-si-in-ni a-ki-ti), V,4.B4,210, Ner. 1, I, 35 (the reconstruction follows H.G. Giiterbock, ZA 40 [1931], 289-90). And Nabonidus mentions a 1festival of the akrtu-temple' (i-sin-nu E a-ki-ti), v.4.B4, 284, Nbn 8, IX, 42. For more examples see CAD, A/I, 267 ff. sub akrtu. For a festival called isin(nu) biti see II.8.1. m II, 6=8. 454 W.G. Lambert, RA 91 (1997), 52-56 (earlier edition by B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi irub, 233-35, no. 9). In this article other Late Babylonian fragments dealing with the procession to the akrtu-temple are also discussed by Lambert, but these are less relevant for our discussion here which aims at reconstructing the chronology of the New Year festival days in Hellenistic Babylon. Note however the small Late Babylonian fragment, BM 77028 (ib., 71-74): it was probably written in Borsippa, but, as Lambert suggests, the fragment presents a recitation belonging to a ritual which probably deals with the boat trip of Marduk and the king of Babylon, well-known to be part of the procession to the akrtu-temple during the New Year festival in Babylon. No indication of the day on which this occurred is given. In the badly preserved colophon the tablet is referred to as 1tablet 25 of the series EN ... ' (rev. 4), which may suggest that is was part of the large series of tablets describing the New Year festival in Babylon, as known especially from RAcc. 455 See II.4.5. I. 456 Rather than indicating the departure of Bel from the akrtu-temple on day 12, as Lambert suggests, RA 91 (1997), 53. 457 A.J. Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries, no. -245, A, obv. 12'-13'. Cf. R.J. van der Spek, in: H. Sancisi.Weerdenburg e.a. (eds.), De Agricultura, 72, who assumes that the king probably did not visit Babylon, but that offerings were made on behalfofthe king and his sons. Another diary (no. -161, A1,A2, obv. 27'-29') describes events on days 10 and 11 ofNisannu: the damaged passage refers to sheep and the dude gate of Esagila, but no reference to the New year festival is made. Another diary, no. -77, A, 'Obv. 12', relates to the assembly (kinistu) and administrator (satammu) ofEsagila and mentions a festival (isinnu) during the first month Nisannu, but because of the broken context it is not clear whether this refers to the New Year festival. We must be careful with these kind of references, even when they mention the akftu-temple, because this temple was not only used during the New Year festival of Nisannu, as is clear for example from BM 32206 +, where a procession ofUsmfr, a slave and a bull to the akrtu-temple is recorded on day 4 ofK.is!Imu. See 11.4.3. Also the astronomical diaries often record events taking place in the akr/u-temple in months other than Nisannu, but usually the relevant passages are badly damaged and the context remains unclear. The month of the second New Year festival, Tasritu, is not attested in connection with this festival, nor with the akrtu-temple. For references to the akrtu-temple (written EDD.I.KAM 'Day one temple' and used as alternative name, cf. R.J. van der Spek, in: J. Wiesehofer (ed.), Das Partherreich und seine Zeugnisse, 225) and the astronomical diaries: no.-204, C, rev. 17 (mentioned above); no. -187, A, rev. 10'; no. -171, B, rev. 4'; no. -170, A, obv. 13'; no. -158, C, 6'-8'; no. -132, D, rev. 12'; no. -129, A2, obv. 20; no. -126, A, rev. 4; no. -124, rev. 16'; no. -88, B, obv. 12'; and no. -79, obv.' 6, dated 233 S.E. (79/8 B.C.), which is the last reference to the akrtu-temple in the diaries. The akrtu-temple is attested in administrative documents as late as 219 S.E. II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals expenditures, which refers to day 1 ofNisannu ( see above), sheep for the regular offerings in the akftu-temple on day 11 ofNisannu are also mentioned, 458which presumably means that Bel has returned from the akftu-templeand is back in Esagila. Some concluding remarks When we compare the data from Uruk: and Babylon, we must conclude that for Hellenistic Uruk: only the data for the Tasritu version are reasonably certain. Here preparations for the procession took seven days, after which the procession left on day 8 and returned to the Res-temple on day 9. The festivities lasted another two days. Furthermore we have indications which suggest that in Uruk the Nisannu version of the festival was probably similar to the Tasritu version, but no certain data have been preserved for the days on which the procession took place. In Hellenistic Babylon the Nisannu version follows the schedule used in the Neo.Babylonian period: the procession left on day 8, and did not return to Esagila earlier than on day 11 of Nisannu. The Tasritu festival in Babylon remains unclear. The fact that the days, on which certain cultic activities of the New Year festival are held, are not the same in the various cities, as seems to be the case in Hellenistic Uruk: and Babylon, has already been established by others. 459 Table XV: the New Year festival in Hellenistic Uruk: and Babylon date  god  place  text  7-1  Anu  Uruk  TU 39--40  (8-1)  Anu  Uruk  KAR 132  10-1  Anu  Uruk  TU43  11-1  Anu  Uruk  TU43  1-11-VII  Anu  Uruk  TU 39-40  (8-VII)  Anu  Uruk  BRM4,  7  1-1  Bel  Babylon  <;agirgan,Festivals, I; AB 244  2-5-1  Bel  Babylon  RAcc., 127ff.  6-1  Bel  Babylon  RAcc., 127ff.  ( 6/7/8(?)-I)  Bel  Babylon  BM41577  8-1  Bel  Babylon  Diaries, no.-204; SBH VIII;  Grayson, Chronicles,no. 13b  11-1  Bel  Babylon  SBH VIII; Diaries, no. -245; AB 244  7-VII(?)

459 See W.G. Lambert, JSS 13 ( 1968), I 07, where he noticed that the day, on which the great battle between 
Marduk and Tiamat during the New Year festival in Nisannu could occur, varies in the texts from day 8, 10 
or 11. 
II.4.6. The brazier festivals The kinilnu 'brazier, hearth' (KI.NE, rarely KI.NE.NE) is a cult object used in cere.monies and rituals throughout the year, but also special brazier festivals are known. Brazier festivals are attested in documents from the Ur III and Old Babylonian peri.ods.460 Ceremonies with the kinunu are less well-known from the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods.46! For the Hellenistic period462 we have a reference to the cer.emonies with the brazier in the Uruk ritual text TU 38,463 which lists several ceremonies and offerings up.der the classification par~u. This text also informs us that loaves and cakes and furthermore oxen and sheep were apparently used during the ceremony with the kinilnu.The ceremonies with the kinunuprobably took place during night vigils, as in earlier periods.464 Cohen has suggested465 that there is evidence for a brazier festival in the Eanna.temple in Late Neo-Babylonian Uruk in the ninth month Kislimu,466 and also for a brazier festival in the Esagila-temple in Hellenistic Babylon in the ninth month Kis1Imu, but note that references to the kinilnubegin as early as the eight month Ara.bsamna, and continued into the tenth month Tebetu (also known as Kiniinu the 'brazier month').467 Note also that the months referred to are all winter-months. Another brazier called garakku is not often mentioned in Hellenistic temple ritual texts. However, it plays an important role in the eclipse of the moon ritual from Uruk, described in BRM 4, 6.468 460 M.E. Cohen, Cu/tic calendars, 392 ff. 461 CAD, K, 395a and AHw, 481-2. Cf. G. van Oriel, Cult of Assur, 168 and A.C.V.M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebabbar temple at Sippar, 21, n. 47. 462 See G .J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 163. 463 Obv. 37 and rev. 37. 464 Cf.RMA no. 151, rev. 7-10 (= H. Hunger, SAA VIII (1992), p. 211, no. 371, rev. 10), which mentions a kinunu-ceremony talcing place during the night of the nineteenth of K.islrmu. I already argumented against McEwanls idea (FAOS4, 163), that this is confirmed by the list in TU 38, see II.1. 465 Cu/tic calendars, 393::4. á 466 LKU, no. 51, rev. 13-18. . 467 BRM 4, 25 // SBH VII, obv. 5ff. (for day 18 of the eighth month Arabsamna), obv. 26 ff. (for days 9, 10, 17 and 22 of the ninth month K.islimu), obv. 50ft'. (for the tenth day of the tenth month Tebetu). There is more supporting evidence for brazier ceremonies on the fourth day of the ninth month Kislimu, in the Esagila ritual text BM 32206 +, I'V.149, 152, 154, 155, l 56, all on day four ofKisl'imu ( cf. Lambert's remark on p. 90a top). Another occurrence of kinunu was suggested by G.J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 87-88, and B. Funck, Uruk zur Se[eukidenzeit, 217-17: BRM 2, 22, 7 // Weisberg, BiMes 24, no.I, 7, a private contract from Hellenistic Uruk, reads in obv. 7 (see also rev. 21): ... ijA.LA saina si1KJ.E.NE.NE.MESsa d!NNIN.MESgab-bi While Clay, BRM 2, p. 24 apparently already identified the correct logogram (he reads: i,melultuP¥sa Istarati¥'the festivities(?) of Ashtoreth, all of it'), L. T. Doty ( CAHU, l 33 with n. 266) suggested ijilKJ.E.NE.DE .., ESEMEN '"' keppu ¥'jump rope". This was however not followed by McEwan, who read slJkinunisa istarliti.MES gab-bi ¥'the braziers of all the goddesses,', and Funck, who preferred: is-qi-e BIL.BIL.MES, ¥'denAnteil an den Feueropfernf. keppu,'skipping-rope.' has to be preferred, because kinunuis usually written Kl.NE or rarely Kl.NE.NE, but never Kl.E.NE.NE; furthermore, keppu has, unlike kinunu and me/ultu, the determinative GIS and is often attested with dJNNlN ,'the goddess' (see the dictionaries for references); see also R. Borger,ABZ, 237a, who also gives ESEMEN~ Kl.E.NE.DI, and ESEMEN~ Kl.E.NE.DI.AN.MUS or Kl.E.NE.DI.dINNJN. So, probably we should read in BRM 2, 22, obv. 7:,'(his) share in the skipping-ropes of all the goddesses,'. 468 Obv. 14=-18, 29-30, rev. 37-38. It is well-known in texts from earlier periods, see for instance, T.G. Pinches, Berens Coll., no. I 10, obv. 2 and passim in this text;LKU no. 51, obv. 8 (napisu ina mub!Ji garakka), IO,19, 20.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals II.5. The kettledrum ritual One of the instruments used during ceremonies and rituals was the kettledrum (Akk. lilissu).411 The kettledrum, usually made of bronze, is attested from the Old Akkadian period on. 472 We must distinguish between, on the one hand, the kettledrum as a cultic object and used as a musical instrument as one of the means of averting divine anger, and on the other hand the ritual for the covering of the kettledrum: here the drum is also a cult object, but now it is the main protagonist of a ritual during which a bull is slaughtered and its hide is used to cover (ariimu) the drum. First we will discuss the different occurrences of the kettledrum, and then we will describe the ritual. 11.5.1. The kettledrum In many ceremonies the kettledrum plays an important part. It is often connected with the verb sakiinu 'to place', which however, depending on the context, can also mean 'to play'. In several ritual texts from the Neo-Assyrian period we find occasional references to days on which the kettledrums were played (lilisiiti).413 In a Neo-or Late Babylonian cultic calendar text from Sippar, BM 50503, the kettledrum is used to accompany the lamentation priest reciting taqribtus and ersemakkuson the days [l?]-8-15-20 of every month in Ebabbar, the temple of Samas.474 From the late Neo-Babylonian or early Achaemenid period we have one text from Uruk, LKU, no. 51, listing ceremonies for Belet-sa-Uruk, U~ur-amassu and Aska'itu for all twelve months of the year. The kettledrum is used during these ceremonies on at least eight separate days: on one or more unknown days of month rv,on day 17-IV, on the days 1 and 2-VII, on day 2-XII, on day 3-XII, on day [4]-XII, and on day 5-XII.475 The kettledrum is also attested in ritual texts from Hellenistic Uruk, but none of the days mentioned in LKU, no. 51 is attested. During an !star festival described in TU 42 + a kettledrum is placed on a sul,!Ju-standin the cella of !star in her akftu-temple outside of Uruk,476 which can be connected with LKU, no. 51,477 which informs us that on an unknown day during the first half of the fourth month Du'iizu478 Nanaja sits next to Belet-sa-Uruk (!star), the kettledrum is placed, and then lifted up again to take 411 Wr. LI.LI.iZ, LILIZ and syllabically. Besides the kettledrum we also find other instruments used in the 
cult: the a/u-drum, the balaggu-harp, the uppu-drum, the manzu-drum, the !Jal!Jallatu-drum,the tigu-drum, 
the abgalgungunm1-drum, the mii/i/u-flute and the tibbuttultimbutu-harp. However, not all are attested in 
texts from the Hellenistic period. For the drum types played by the lamentation priests see D. Brown and the 
present author in RA 91 (1997), 162 (note I').

part in a procession, after which the kettledrum is placed on a su!J!Ju-stand,perhaps in Belet-~a-Uruk's cella in Eanna. The kettledrum is also used during the Uruk eclipse of tfi.e moon ritual, more specifically in the third version of the ritual, dealing with the duties of the lamentation priest.479 As we will discuss elsewhere, in this ritual the kettledrum is used as a musical instrument, serving the purpose of averting the evil consequences of the lunar eclipse, and furthermore it plays an important part as a cult object in the ritual.480 In another Uruk ritual text, W 18728,481describing clothing instructions for cult personnel and the king, the consecrated lamentation priest (kalu gullubu), probably belonging to the regular personnel of the temple, is dressed with linen /ubaru-clothing; as long as he wears this clothing he is not allowed to sit near the kettledrum. After a passage which deals with the unconsecrated lamentation priest (kalu la gullubu), the chief singer of dirges (galama!Ju)is mentioned who also must take off the lubiiru.clothingá before he can sit near the kettledrum. At first sight this passage seems clear: as long as he wears this clothing the kettledrum cannot be used to accompany him when he recites lamentations. This, however, appears to be contradicted in the eclipse ritual text mentioned above: during the eclipse, i.e. when there is a threat of imminent danger, the people of the land and the lamentation priests have to cover their heads with (torn) /ubiiru-clothing,482 which by itself is not unexpected: the clothing is worn as a gesture of mourning. However, while in W 18728 the lamentation priest must not come near the drum as long as he wears the lubiiru-clothing, in the eclipse text there is no reference to the lamentation priests taking off this clothing when they begin reciting the lamentations, presumably accompanied by kettledrum music. What the exact signifi.!;ance of the passage in W 18728 is remains unclear, but it is clear that the lamentation priest cannot approach the kettledrum wearing /ubiiru-clothing, indicating some kind of negative or unclean association with this clothing, while the kettledrum is generally assumed to be positive. 483 The kettledrum is also mentioned in a ritual text from Hellenistic Babylon: BM 32206 +484 describes ceremonies performed during days 3 and 4 of the month Kis1Imu. First several events concerning Bel and several other cult-participants on day 3 ofK.islimu in Esagila take place, leading up to the journey of a slave, riding on a bull, and Usmu to the akitu-templeon day 4, and their return on the same day to Esagila.485Taking part in the events in Esagila is the kettledrum of Bel, and the kettledrum of Beltija.486 No reference to the slaughtering of the bull, or the covering of the drum is made ( as in the ritual with 419 BRM 4, 6, rev. 42ff. // BM 134701, obv. 1 ff.

the kettledrum, discussed below), although a drum skin(?) (buppu) is mentioned.487 The function of the bull is probably to carry the slave to and from the akftu-temple, as is clear from col. Ill, 115, where the slave descends from the bull when he has arrived in Esagila. Another reference to the kettledrum follows,488 and during the night of day 3 a kettledrum of Bel and a kettledrum of Ea are used.489 The description of day 4490 contains the arranging of the alu-drum, in the same manner as for day 8 of Tasritu.491 No mention of the kettledrum is made until the procession is back in Esagila,492 but the context is not clear because the relevant passage is partly damaged. Finally, in col. IV, 158 the text refers to a kettledrum (lamentation) 'It touches the Earth like a storm' (UD.D[AM KJI AM.US),which however is not attested in the kettledrum ritual texts discussed below.493 Finally, according to a calendar text priests will beat a kettledrum, together with an abgalgungunnu-drum, on day 25 of the eighth month Arabsamna, after which the former is removed. 494 This leaves us with only three attested pieces of data for the kettledrum, day 25-VIII, and days 3-4-IX, all from Babylon. 11.5.2. The ritual of the covering of the kettledrum The ritual of covering the kettledrum is described in texts from the Neo-Assyrian period (Assur, Nineveh), and from the Hellenistic period, but only from Uruk.495 Although as we saw the kettledrum is attested in texts from Babylon, no ritual texts from Hellenistic Babylon are known which describe the covering of the kettledrum. However, we have two references in the astronomical diaries, which indicate that as we would expect the ritual was also practiced in Babylon. The ritual is mentioned in a diary for day 24 of the month Arabsamna in the year 41 S.E. (271 B.C.): 13' [ ... 1t1MA]S.MAS.MES 1LAGAR.MESne-pe-suu 1tsaa-ra-mu sali-[li-si DV-u (?)] '[ ... the e]xorcists and the lamentation priests [performed(?)] the ritual procedure for the covering of the kettle[ drum]' .496 4&1 Col.

In another diary, dealing with the month Ajjaru of the year 85 S.E., a reference is made to the temple workshop (bft mummz); then a sheep is bound(?), after which the kettledrum is mentioned. Finally incantations are recited, presumably by an exorcist.497 The passage is damaged, but the reference to the temple workshop especially and to the incantations remind us of the covering of the kettledrum ritual, as we will see. Here we will concentrate on the continuity of the kettledrum ritual: is it possible to see whether the ritual in the Neo-Assyrian period was different from the ritual in the Hellenistic period? We have several texts which give us good insight into the ritual, and generally they follow the same procedures, but there are also differences. We will first describe the ritual as it is described in the most important text, TU 44, which will be used here as the ba~is text, and compare this with other kettledrum ritual texts from the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods. TU44 The most elaborate version of the ritual, TU 44, was written in Hellenistic Uruk (the text is discussed in the Appendix.). The ritual begins with an enuma-phrase: 'When y[ou] want [to cover] the kettledrum (proceed as follows)' .498 First, a knowledgeable expert ( ummanu) selects a black bull. 499 Then 'on a favorable day' the bull is led into the workshop (bft mummz), where it is ritually prepared for the slaughtering. 500 1\velve gods (figurines) are prepared. After this the kettledrum is positioned, the curtains are drawn shut, and the washing of the mouth ceremony (mfs pi) is performed on the bull. After a number of incantations and lamentations have been recited, the bull is slaughtered. 501 Its heart is burned, the sinew from its left thigh, which will be used later, is removed, and part of the carcass of the bull is buried in a cloth. Aside from the sinew more is left unburied: the face of the bull is placed towards the West, and the hide is soaked in flour, water, beer and wine. More preparations with the hide follow (laying it in ghee from a pure cow, steeping it with madder and alum), and then the kettledrum is covered with it, using a linen rope, wooden pegs, and the sinew, after which the remainder of the tanned hide is buried. 502 Next a short explanatory passage follows which enumerates three groups totalling twelve gods: the three great gods Anu, Enlil and Ea, the twins Lugalgirra and Meslam.taea, and the seven children of Enme¤arra. 503 No explanation is given for these names here, but the duplicate IV R2,23, no. 1 +, I, 6 identifies the last group of seven gods as the sons ofEnmesarra: 'The seven gods, sons ofEnmesarra, are (represented by) heaps of flour'. The twelve gods are probably the same figurines mentioned above, and they are placed in the kettledrum before it is covered, as is clear from the comment in the 497 A.J.Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries,no. -226, A, obv. 22'-23'. See W.Horowitz,NABU 1991, no. 80.

following lines 7-8: 'You will lay down twelve bronze gods into the bronze kettledrum and (then) you will cover the kettledrum'.504 The ritual continues: on day 15 the kettledrum is brought out before Samas, five offering accoutrements are arranged for Ea, Samas,Marduk, Luniba (also written dBALAG 'the divine harp' in the duplicate KAR 60, see the Appendix) and the (now) divine kettledrum (dLJLIZ), although only after this is the drum consecrated, purified, and the washing of the mouth ceremony performed on it. Then the drum is led before the gods and placed in a bed of barley seeds. After the lamentation LUGAL DIMMER ANKIA 'The king, god of Heaven and Earth'sosthe ritual ends.506 At the end of col. III a warning is added for the user of the tablet not to reveal its contents to anyone who is not competent.507 Finally col. IV enumerates all the materials and foodstuffs used during the ritual. The text ends with a colophon, which explicitly states that the text belongs to the ritual procedure (nepesu)of the lamentation priest.sos Evidence from Nineveh and Assur: IV R2, 23, no. 1 +, KAR 50 and KAR 60 The Nineveh text IV R2, 23, no. 1 + is a catalogue of recitations, which had to be performed during the kettledrum ritual (the text is given in the Appendix.). It belongs to the corpus of the lamentation priest, as is specifically stated in the colophon.509 The text enumerates several recitations which have to be performed during the kettledrum ritual, but it also records a few passages from the ritual itself.SIO The text carefully records at which moment during the ritual a specific recitation has to be performed. It concentrates for the most part on the recitations, but we lmow that it was the first of a series of tablets describing the entire ritual, because the catchline refers to the bull entering the . workshop, which, as we saw in TU 44, is the first step in the ritual after it has been inspected. These procedures are enumerated on separate tablets, which constitute our kettledrum ritual texts. Descriptions for the kettledrum ritual in the Neo-Assyrian period are recorded in two text from Assur, KAR 50 and KAR 60 (both texts are given in the Appendix). On the obverse of KAR 50511 we find a bilingual incantation for 'the choice bull, the creation of the great gods'. The reverse describes the actual ritual. The text is apparently a shorter version of the ritual, compared with TU 44. After describing several offerings and purifications, the text explicitly describes how the bull was led into the workshop S04 See also II, 8-9. Cf. W.G. Lambert,JSS 13 (1968), 109---10; A.

sos III, 28, presented in full in BRM 4, 8, bilingual hymn to Anu, 61 S.E; cf. M.E. Cohen, Lamentations,

the month, wassung after the covering of the kettledrum was completed, and not while the drum was still 
being repaired. Therefore the recitation of lamentation to the accompaniment of the kettledrum did not serve 
the purpose of neutralising the divine anger, but was a means of testing the new drum.

m Part of the text is duplicated by the Nineveh texts K 6060 (BBR2, no. 56) + K 10820 (unpublished, see Plate II). For details see the discussion of the text in the Appendix. (described here as 'a secluded place', i.e. forbidden for outsiders)512 'in the morning, before sunrise'513(elsewhere not attested, although clear from the context). The text continues, in a very abbreviated passage, with the incantations which have to be recited, the slaughtering of the bull and the removing of the hide and sinew for the covering of the kettlec1rum.s14 More important for the comparison with TU 44 is another kettledrum ritual text from the áNeo-Assyrian period, KAR 60. It is clear that in general the same procedures are followed, but the Uruk text desctjbes all the ceremonies up to the slaughtering of the bull much more extensively51S than the Assur text.516 In addition, the enumeration of all the foo~tuffs and materials, used during the ritual, is only attested in TU 44.517 Furthermore, only in TU 44 is a short explanatory passage given.sis There is one major difference between TU 44 and KAR 60. While the Uruk text first describes the slaughtering of the bull, and immediately continues with the covering of the kettledrum, the Assur text describes a special additional ceremony with the lamentation priest519: he must uncover his head, kneel down and stand at the head of the bull, where he has to recite the prayer 'He, who lies asleep' three times. Then he must say: 'these ritual acts the totality-of-the-gods has performed, I did not perform (them)'520 three times, after which the lamentation priest opens the curtains and this special ceremony. is ended. This passage has been discussed by Oppenheim.521 The uncovering of the head and kneeling down is a typical position of penitence, and was necessary here because the priest was responsible for the crime he has committed: the killing of the bull, a sacred animal. That is why first he has to recite a lamentation for the dead three times, and then he has to decline the responsibility for killing the animal three times. Furthermore, in rev. 14we read that the head of the lamentation priests, the chief singer of dirges (galamii!Ju) is forbidden to eat the meat from the bull. Apparently the lamentation priests were allowedto eat the meat, but not the chief singer of dirges, because he was considered to have been responsible for killing the bull. This is interesting because in TU 44 the animal was carefully buried.522 The Uruk text also mentions the burial of the remainder of the tanned hide.s23 Oppenheim concluded that the inclusion of this ceremony in the ritual and the referenceto the chief singer of dirges clearly show that between the Neo-Assyrian and the Hellenistic period major changes took place. However, we now have evidence from Hellenistic Uruk which might suggest otherwise. 512 Rev. 8

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals More evidence from Hellenistic Uruk: Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5524 Apart from TU 44 we have another kettledrum ritual text from Hellenistic Uruk, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, which allows us to follow the ritual procedures closely. Surprisingly this text is closer to the older Assur version then the other Hellenistic Uruk version TU 44525: the ceremonies that follow after the leading of the bull into the workshop 526 are described in a much shorter version than in TU 44, and resemble more the Assur text. After this the bull was slaughtered in front of the kettledrum (ina IGI LI.LI.iZ).527 Note that in the duplicate KAR 60 the bull was placed for Lumba (dBALAG)and then slaughtered. 528 Next the bull's heart is scattered with juniper. 529 This interesting passage is paralleled by KAR 60,530 but not by TU 44, where the heart is burnt in front of the kettledrum together with cedar,juniper and ma~batu-flour.531 For this reason Thureau-Dangin, who did not know of Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, suggested that KAR 60 should be restored to make it fit TU 44.532But ifwe assume that the restoration proposed by Thureau-Dangin is not necessary, then we have here another indication that TU 44 on the one hand and KAR 60 and Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5 on the other represent two separate versions of the ritual. The next passage in Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5 is badly damaged, 533 but may have contained the special ceremony with the lamentation priest attested in KAR 60.534 The hide is then prepared and the drum covered with it.535 There are also parallels with TU 44. Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, like the other Uruk text TU 44, appears to begin with the enuma-phrase 'When y[ou want to cover the kettledrum (proceed as follows)]' ,536but we know that in the Neo-Assyrian period the enuma-phrase was also used, as is clear from the catchline in IV R2, 23, no. 1 +, IV, 25.537More important, the end of the text describes, like TU 44, the burial of the carcass of the bull with the remainder of the hide,538 which is, as noted above, not in accordance with the Assur text. 524 Not discussed here is a small badly damaged fragment, Bagh.

describes part of the kettledrum ritual; for a transliteration see my comments on IV R2, 23, no. 1 +, I, 17, in

II.5. The kettledrum ritual Another text from Hellenistic Uruk, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 7, also appears to follow the shorter version of KAR 60 and Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5.539 Of special interest here is obv, 6', which, if it follows the duplicate KAR 60,540 refers to the chief singer of dirges, who may not eat meat from the bull. If restored correctly, this clearly shows that in Hellenistic Uruk the chief singer of dirges is also not allowed to eat meat from the bull, as in the Neo-Assyrian period. Oppenheim's conclusion, based on KAR 60, cannot stand any longer. 11.5.3. Who performed the kettledrum ritual? The kettledrum ritual texts indicate that the ritual belongs to the text corpus of the lamentation priest (kalutu), which explains the dominant position oflamentations in the ritual. The lamentation priest, who is usually addressed in the second person (the 'you'.figure),541was not only responsible for the lamentations, but also took charge of many of the other cultic activities, such as making offerings and libations, and performing consecrations and purifications. However, the two passages in the astronomical diaries mentioned above clearly state that the kettledrum ritual was performed by exorcists and lamentation priests. Horowitz already pointed out that, with the exception of the passages in the ~stronomical diaries, the exorcist is not attested in connection with the kettledrum ritual.542 Clearly in the kettledrum ritual texts the duties of the exorcist are not referred to, only those of the lamentation priest are described. 543 Furthermore, although we know that the exorcist played a major part in other temple rituals from Uruk and Babylon,544 in the kettledrum ritual many of the tasks, which are usually connected with the exorcist, are apparently performed by lamentation priests.s45 Some concluding remarks It is clear that the kettledrum ritual texts demonstrate an astonishing continuity of this tradition. We have different versions of the ritual, a longer one from Hellenistic Uruk (TU 44), and a shorter one from both Assur and Hellenistic Uruk (KAR 60, KAR 50, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, nos. 5 and 7), but although the relation between the two versions is not exactly clear (in particular, are both Uruk-versions based on one older composition?), 539 Obv.2-9 is probably a duplicate of KAR 60, rev. 10-15 andBagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, rev.29-31. For a 
transliteration of these lines see my comments on KAR 60, rev. 10-15, in the Appendix. 
540 Rev. 14. 
541 Note that in KAR 60 the ¥you'-figure is mentioned together with the lamentation priest (in the third 
person). 
542 RA 85 (1991), 76. 
543 The same is true for the building ritual texts, see 11.6.3. In the cultic calendar texts TU 48, K 2724 + 
(see II.2.2) and BM 50503 (recently published by St. M. Maul, in: Munuscula Mesopotamica. Festschrift 
for Johannes Renger, Munster,1999, 285 ff., cf. his remark on p. 291) only the activities of the lamentation priests are described. 544 See 1.3. 545 Note that in the Nineveh text IV R2, 23, no. I +the two incantations, usually connected with the exorcist, are also performed by the ~yoll"-figure (I, 19ff.), presumably the lamentation priest. there is probably no major change in tradition between the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods as far as the general procedures of the ritual are concerned. The highlight of the ritual was the procedure with the bull. This is underlined by the fact that the curtains were drawn shut before it was prepared (as we lmown from TU 44, KAR 50 and IV R2,23, no. 1 +), and were opened again when the bull was slaughtered and recitations were performed (KAR 60, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5 and IV R2, 23, no. 1 +).546 . Finally, we do not have many data on days during which the kettledrum ritual was performed. Only day 15 in Uruk (TU 44), and days x-Il-85 S.E. and 24-VIII-41 S.E. in Babylon (Diaries,nos. -226 and -270) are attested. This can be explained by the fact that the ritual for covering the kettledrum was not part of the regularly performed temple rituals, but was only performed when repairs on the kettledrum were necessary.547 Some of the texts contain the reference 'in an auspicious month, on a favourable day' (ina ITI SE.GA UD SE.GA),548 which indicates that it was an occasional ritual: the same phrase is also used in the building ritual texts549 and we must assume that this ritual was only performed on the occasion of rebuilding a temple. The occasional character of the ritual is also confirmed by the fact that the lamentations, recited during the ritual, are not accompanied by an exact date, as known from other texts.sso The lamentations were performed when a drum needed to be covered, and the days for this ritual were not set. 11.6. The building ritual Within the Babylonian cult the ritual for the rebuilding of a temple was important.551 From Hellenistic Uruk several major building ritual texts are known.552 Although the colophons do not refer to older originals, these texts must have had parallels from the Neo-and Late Babylonian periods, of which one is preserved.553 Although from Hellenistic Babylon no building ritual texts are known, we do have one example f'r9m the Late Babylonian period, which interestingly enough is to a large extent duplicated by the Uruk texts.554 These texts form the basic material from which we have reconstructed the building ritual. 555 S46 The procedure with the curtains is explained in IIl.3.

sss We can trace the kaliitu-typebuilding ritual back to the Neo-Assyrian period, cf. the small Ninevite 
fragment K 5260 (K..D. Macmillan, BA SN, LVI, cf. p. 702). STT 232, which is concerned with the 
rebuilding/restoration of a door (cf. E. Reiner, JNES 26 [1967], 188), has similarities with TU 45. Other 
types of building rituals are known. For a short survey see F.A.M. Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Protective 
Spirits. The ritual texts, Groningen, 1992, 127f. 
From the textual evidence it appears that there are two different versions of the building ritual. In this paragraph we will attempt to reconstruct these two versions. II.6.1. The.first version We will start with the most -elaborate version of the ritual, TU 45. On two occasions the ritual is identified as belonging to the ritual procedure (nepesu) of the lamentation priest.556 The text has a special structure. It is divided into four sections, separated by a cross.line, each describing a day.557 Furthermore, the days are separated into two sub-sections, introduced by 'on a favourable day'; the described events apparently take place during the night {ina GE6), as is attested for the first and fourth days,sss and 'in the morning' (ina se-ri), and they are also separated by a cross-line.559 Only on the first day is the introduction of the sub-section referred to as 'in an auspicious month, on a favourable day',s60and appears to follow without a cross-line.56! The text is interrupted by either a line, in which the ritual is attributed to the lamentation priest,562 or one or two omens.563 Like the kettledrum ritual, the building ritual TU 45 also begins with an eniima.phrase: 'When the wall of the temple of Anu buck[les, to demolish and renovate that temple] .. .'. 564 Then, 'in an auspicious month, on a favourable day, in the night', offerings, libations, and lamentations are performed for the god of the temple (Anu), the goddess of the temple (Antu), and the protective spirit (lamassu) of the temple, and also for Ea and Marduk.565 Similar procedures are performed in the morning, this time on the roof of the temple, for Ea, Samas and Marduk.566 Then the curtains are drawn shut, indicating that now the most important part of the ritual is about to begin.567 Four lamentations are recited to Ea, Samas and Marduk. The curtains are opened (loosened) agafo, and the ritual ends.s6s Two omens follow, which conclude the description of the first day.569 On the second day similar procedures are followed during the night, but now the king takes part in the ritual: he has to recite a special lamentation and ersemsabungu.prayers.s10 ss6 Obv. 1S, rev. 2. 5s1 Obv. 2ff.; I7ff.; rev.

Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries,no. -229, B, obv. S'-11 '); a lamentation priest is refered to, and the chief singer of dirges (recites?) ersabungu-tablets(no. -226, B, rev. l'-2'). II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals After more offerings and libations, and a lamentation, ersemsa!Jungu-prayersare recited by the king in the morning.571 Then a special ceremo:p.y follows572: the king prostrates himself (sukenu),the barber shaves off the hair of his body, and puts it into a bottle, after which it is sent off to the enemy's border. The king returns to his palace. This ceremony has been the subject of much discussion, concentrating on the question whether the ceremony served the purpose of purifying the king, or whether it had the function of protecting the land from an enemy. According to Mayer the c~remony is an 'Abwehrritus' _573 The hair, which represents the power of the king even when it is shaven off, has the purpose of holding back the enemy from the border in order to protect the land from disaster. Danger from an enemy outside or from trouble within the land has also been announced in the omen in obv. 16: '(An omen says:) if the earth quakes, (then) an enemy will rise and the dwellings of the land will not be secure. (Another omen says:) if the earth turns around, (then) there will be injustice in the whole land, the land will turn mad'. Furthermore, TU 45 informs us that lamentations and ersemsa!Jungu.prayers are recited over the king's hem in each and every sanctuary; if these instructions are followed, evil will not approach the king.574 Finally, although the ceremony is not repeated in TU 45, several more omens appear,575 all announcing some kind of danger for the king, the city or the land. So, warding off danger appears to be at least one reason for the recording of this special ceremony with the omens.576 Two more omens follow, and the description of the second day ends. s77 The third day again begins with offerings, libations, a lamentation, and ersemsa!Jun.gu-prayers, to be recited over the king's hem, this time, for the god of the city (Anu), the goddess of the city (Antu), and the protective spirit (lamassu) of the city.578 The procedures of the ritual continue 'in the open country or on the bank of a river, on a place where nobody sets foot', and similar procedures follow for Anu, Enlil and Ea, but also for the god of the open country and the goddess of the open country.579 A special interlinear line mentions the exorcist who, together with the lamentation priest, has to purify the city.580 Three more omens conclude the description of the third day.ss1 The section concerning the fourth day begins with the same procedures as for the third day, for 'that god, that goddess'(= Anu and Antu?), Masdub and Samas, but now the king himself has to perform the ersemsalJungu-prayersagain.582 In the morning 57 1 Obv. 20ff.

576 St.M. Maul (Zukunftsbewiiltigung, Mainz am Rhein, 1994, 76, n. 47; see also 78) pointed out that, while 
the hair indeed had the function of giving protection against any danger, at the same time in many rituals 
the shaving of the hair, an unclean element, served the purpose of purifying the person, in this case the 
king. According to J.S. Cooper (in: M.E. Vogelzang, H.J.L. Vanstiphout, Mesopotamian Poetic Language, 
Groningen, 1996, 53,n. 24) the ceremony has a mainly purifying function.

purifications and offerings are performed on the roof of the temple for Ea, Samas and Marduk. After another lamentation is performed and the king recites ersemsabungu.prayers, the temple is consecrated, which must be the final goal of the ritual. After the king has performed another lamentation and made a gift, the ritual ends.583 We have two more text (fragments) from Hellenistic Uruk, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, nos. 10 and 11 (the latter in fact consists of five smaller fragments). They are both clearly duplicates of TU 45, and appear to represent the first version of the ritual.584 However, one of the fragments belonging to Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 11585 contains a ceremony concerning the building-master and the first brick, and (the incipit of) the prayer 'When Anu created Heaven'.586 These are not mentioned in TU 45, but we encounter them in the texts belonging to the second version of the ritual, to which this fragment apparently belongs.587 II.6.2. The second version Several building ritua1 texts are known, which are clearly different from the version described in TU 45 and parallels. Two of them, TU 46 and SpTU 4, no. 141, come from Uruk. Uruk The second building ritual text from Hellenistic Uruk, TU 46, is only partly paralleled by TU 45, and most of the text is quite different. For example, the special ceremony concerning the king and the omens, attested in TU 45, is missing here. The text is identified twice as belonging to the ritual procedure of the lamentation priest.588 The beginning of TU 46589 appears to be a duplicate of the section describing the first day of the ritual, as recorded in TU 45.590 The only difference in this part of the text follows the enuma-phrase('[When] the wall of the temple buckles'): the diviner is mentioned, deconsecrating the emplacement (the building plot) of the temple.59! After this the text follows the same procedures as described for the first day in TU 45. The ceremony behind the curtains is also described, although the reference to drawing the curtains shut592 is erroneously left out.593 ssl Rev.20 ff.

S9l Obv. 9 ff. II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals But now a new section begins, in which the ceremony concerning the first brick (libittu mabritu), performed by the building-master (itinnu),594is describeq.595 Ellis argues that this first brick is probably a former brick which was removed from the old temple, and then re-used in the construction of the new temple; because the brick embodied the essence of the temple, the house of the god, the continuity of worship was assured.596 The building-master has to remove this first brick with an axe made oflead, and place it in a secluded temple. Offerings and libations are performed before the brick for the god of the foundation, who is not named, and the lamentation priest recites the prayer 'When Anu created Heaven' in front of the brick. A supplement (? [DI]RI.GA) follows, in which the duties of the diviner are de.scribed597: the intestines of a lamb are inspected, and if the result is good, the demolishing and renovating of the temple will be for the good of the king and the land. The reverse is apparently concerned with the second day of the ritual, describing the laying of a temple foundation.598 These procedures include offerings, libations and lamentations, partly attested also in TU 45, for the god, goddess and the protective spirit (lamassu)of the temple. Again the curtains are drawnshut for the most important moment of the ceremony, which consists of reciting the lamentations, and also the suillakku-prayer 'When Anu, Enlil and Enki created Heaven and Earth'. 599Erroneously, no reference is made to opening the curtains again. After the foundation is laid, the temple is consecrated, and the ritual ends. The text only describes a part of the ritual, because, as the catchline indicates, 600 it is only one of a series of tablets belonging to the building ritual. Because this catchline refers to the doorframes, apparently the othertablet(s) is/are concerned with the different parts of the temple, but no examples are preserved. A Late Babylonian text from Uruk, Sp TU 4, no. 141, also contains a part of the building ritual belonging to the text corpus of the lamentation priest (kaliitu);the text is much more similar to TU 46 than to TU 45. The obverse contains the prayer 'When Anu created Heaven', also referred to in TU 46.601 The first part of the reverse contains either the continuation of the prayer 'When Anu created Heaven', or more likely another prayer, probably for the well-being of the land and its people.602 The second part, concerned with the activities of the diviner603 is duplicated by TU 46.604 When in TU 46 the laying of the foundations is next described, 605in SpTU 4, no. 141 only the introductory line to this passage is given, followed by the colophon,606 which confirms what we already S94 Wr. 1&SITIM =mubannu,the 'arranger(also attested in F.H.

The building ritual suggested on the basis of the catchline of TU 46, namely that the building ritual of the kalutu-typefrom Uruk was described on a series of tablets. Babylon Another Late Babylonian building ritual text, this time from Babylon, is F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no.12. This text is important for it shows that this particular building ritual of the kalutu-type was not only used in Uruk but also in Babylon. The obverse of the text is parallel to the first part of TU 46.607 However, although the same procedures are described, there are also differences. The lamentation priest is instructed to recite a lamentation, but the incipit is not given, while in TU 46 two lamentations, with the incipits are given. 608Then the Babylon text refers to the singer, who must recite a in'!Ju= song.609 The ceremony which includes reciting four lamentations by the lamentation ,. priest behind the curtains is also given, but no reference is made to the curtains. 6IO After this the ceremony with the building-master and the first brick is described, 611which includes, after the removing of the first brick, the phrase (missing in TU 46): 'he will mourn [for] the temple, say "woe!'" .612Finally the incipit of the prayer 'When Anu created Heaven' is given, after which the prayer is presented in full.613 Of the reverse of the Weissbach text only a small badly damaged part, perhaps containing the continuation of 'When Anu created Heaven', remains. Clearly this text belongs to the version represented by TU 46 and SpTU 4, no. 141. There is also evidence of the use of the second version of this ritual recorded in the astronomical diaries. A passage is preserved, which, as Horowitz has shown,614 refers to a building ritual, performed on day 10 of the twelfth month Addaru, 41 S.E. 615: 15' ... ITI.BI UD.10.KAM [ ... ]

105 II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals Although the ritual of the kettledrum also begins with enuma, this ritual procedure is already referred to in the same passage, line 13'.616 Therefore Horowitz is probably right in identifying the ritual with the ritual for the rebuilding of a temple beginning with: 'When the wall of the temple buckles' (enuma iglir bit ili iqapu). In the Babylon text F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no.12 the ritual ends with the prayer 'When Anu created Heaven' (enuma Anu ibnu same) and according to Horowitz it is this incipit which has to be restored in the diary. The phrase 'as written in front of it' in the diary must refer to the textF.H. Weissbach,Misc., no.12, where the actual ritual (obv. 1-23) is described in front of(= preceding) the passage containing the prayer ( obv. 24 ff.). The existence of two separate versions has been clearly established. But how can we explain the differences between the two versions? The king is prominently present in the first version of the ritual (TU 45 and parallels); he is mentioned several times, while there are no references to him in the second version texts. Why is the king so prominent in the first version, but not in the second? The first section of TU 45617 must perhaps be interpreted as a general introduction to the building ritual. Note that only this part of the text is duplicated in the second version. The rest of the first version does not deal with the general procedures of the ritual, but instead only contains a specific part of the ritual activities performed by the priest addressed in the second person (the 'you' -figure), namely that part in which the king also participates.618 Furthermore, divination is incorporated in the first version. We know that divination played an important part in decision-making before important events, such as the building of a temple, and that it was used to control the behaviour of kings and other important persons. We have several omens in the first version, which alert the king, the people and the land to dangers. These omens must be connected with the role of the king in the ritual. Apparently the first version contains a special programme not only for the leading priest of the ritual, the 'you'-figure, but also for the king. The second version (TU 46 and parallels) begins with (almost) the same general introduction of the building ritual as the first version. But then the important passage concerning the building-master, who performed the ceremony with the first brick, follows. This passage is not mentioned in the first version; clearly the duties of the building-master were not relevant there. Furthermore it is interesting that, except for the enuma-phrase, no more references are made to the demolishing or renovating of the temple in the first version, which is very different from the second version. Only at the end of TU 45 do we learn that the temple is consecrated. 619 Apparently this process of demolishing or renovating was not relevant in this text. But in the second version divination is equally incorporated in the ritual. While no omens are mentioned, the diviner is one of the participants performing the building ritual 616 Discussed in 11.5.2. 611 Obv. 1-14. 
618 The question who this "you'-figure is will be addressed in 11.6.3. 
619 Rev.23. 
II. 6. The building ritual activities. He is mentioned immediately after the introductory line, and he even receives a separate section, which underlines how important divination was for the building of a temple. So, the second version texts also describe how the building ritual had to be performed, but concentrates on other persons: it gives instructions for the 'you'-figure, the diviner, and the building-master. So we clearly have two different versions of one and the same ritual; the existence of the different versions is solely dependant on the participants in the ritual. Because their duties differ from each other they each received their own programme, their own set of instructions. II.6.3. Who pe,formed the building ritual? On several occasions the texts indicate that the building ritual texts belong to the text corpus of the lamentation priest (kalutu); the many lamentation incipits also clearly indicate that the lamentatiqn priest, usually addressed in the second person, is the most important priest at this ritual. However, for the building ritual we also have evidence from the astronomical diaries that both the exorcists and the lamentation priests performed the ritual activities: the astronomical diary, no. -270 can, as we saw, be connected with the second version of the building ritual. Furthermore, in the first version of the building ritual texts, on one occasion only, the exorcist is mentioned together with the lamentation priest. Both are addressed in the third person. 620In the second version, the exorcist is not mentioned. As in the kettledrum ritual, the role of the exorcist in this ritual also appears to be less important. The building ritual texts only concentrate on the duties of the lamentation priest, while the tasks of the exorcist, referred to in the astronomical diary, are left out. 621 II.6.4. Building programmes in Uruk and Babylon We know that under royal supervision large building programmes in Uruk and Babylon were taking place in the Hellenistic period.622 'Iwo Uruk building inscriptions623inform us that in 244B.C. the Res-temple complex of Anu was reconstructed by the governor (saknu)Anu-uballi!, who was given the second name Nikarchos by king Seleucus II, and was further extended in 202/1 B.C. during 620 TU45, rev. 12. Note that this is an interlinear line, perhaps added afterthe text waswritten. The scribes of 
the building ritual texts usually address the leading lamentation priest in the second person, but on occasion 
change to the third person (as in the kettldrwn ritual KAR 60), but there is no doubt that the tyou:-figure is 
always the lamentation priest, as becomes clear when we compare the texts. E.g. in F.H. Weissbach, Misc., 
no.12, a ceremony which includes reciting four lamentations by the lamentation priest (here addressed in the 
third person) is described ( obv. 11 ff.), while in the parallel text TU46 these same lamentations are performed 
by the tyou1-figure (obv. !Off.). See also TU 46, obv. !Sf. and 28; F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no. 12, obv. 4;

the reign of Antiochus III by another Anu-uballit, whose second name was Kephalon. The large Esgal-temple of Istar was also built by this Kephalon, as we know from an Aramaic building inscription from around 200 B.C.624 From Babylon there is more evidence. Alexander planned to restore Esagila and started by removing the debris. 625 After his death this was continued by his successors: Chronicle 10 refers to the removing of the debris of Esagila during the fourth year of the reign of Philippus III, and the sixth and eighth years of Alexander IV.626 The famous building inscription of Antiochus I, dated 268 B.C.,627 refers to bricks which are brought to Babylon and Borsippa for renovating the temples Esagila and Ezida. Although the renovations of Esagila are not mentioned, there is evidence from other sources on this. Horowitz already referred to Chronicle 11628( debris is removed from Esagila), the astronomical diary no. -273 (bricks for the reconstruction of Esagila are made) and the diary, mentioned in 11.6.2, no. -270, referring to the building ritual and which, as Horowitz correctly assumes, probably relates to the reconstruction ofEsagila by Antiochus I.629 Also, during the reign of Demetrius II repair work on Esagila was performed, as we known from diary no. -144. 630 We know that reconstruction work on Esagila continued into the Arsacid period. An astronomical diary testifies to repair works on Esagila in 106 B.C .. 631Administrative documents belonging to the archive of the official Rabimesu (94--92 v.C.) refer to removing debris, repair work and restorations of (parts of) Esagila. 632Also debris on the roof of the akftu-temple (Day One temple) was removed. 633One text mentions expenditures for the restoration of the temple ofMadanu.634 Some concluding remarks Just as with the kettledrum ritual texts, the building ritual texts do not mention the specific days and months on which the ritual was performed.

II.7. The eclipse of the moon ritual an auspicious month, on a favourable day' (ina ITI sal-mu ina VD SE.GA).635The only date that we have, day 10-XII-41, comes from the astronomical diary no. -270.636 Because of the nature of the ritual, no specific regular set of data must be expected: we must assume that the ritual was only performed on the occasion of rebuilding a temple, and for this reason the lamentations, recited during the ritual, are also not accompanied by any such data. When it was necessary to appease the anger of the gods, as was the case when a temple was built, lamentations were used. 637 One important observation concerning the lamentations was made by Cohen 638: in the building ritual the lamentations were recited while the offerings and libations were being performed. Furthermore, they were chanted during the demolition of the old building and not during ceremonies which commemorated the erection of the new building. Apparently the lamentations served the same function as the offerings, according to Cohen: they had to appease the anger of the gods whose sacred buildings are being tom down. In the kettledrum ritual, by contrast, the recitation of lamentations did not serve the purpose of neutralising the divine anger, but was a means of testing the new drum. 639 11.7. The eclipse of the moon ritual From Uruk we have evidence of a ritual which was performed during the course of a lunar eclipse.640 It was probably written during the Hellenistic period.641 This ritual continued until the eclipse had ended, and served the purpose of neutralizing any evil consequences of such a lunar eclipse. 642 The eclipse ritual shows that Uruk as provincial capital of southern Babylonia was an important centre of learning. In this paragraph an attempt is made to explain the composition of the Uruk rituals.643 Although a great deal is known about how the Mesopotamians envisaged the moon and the lunar eclipse, the ritual from Uruk is quite unique and difficult to compare with other evidence on the lunar eclipse.644 The substitute king (.for pu!Ji)ritual, probably performed to avert evil portended by an eclipse on the head of state, is known from the Old Babylonian period on, and appears to have been practised up to the Hellenistic 63S TU 45, obv. 2; see also 17, rev. 5 and 17; TU 46, obv. 2; 23; rev. 2; Bagh.

period.645 In Neo-Assyrian letters there are allusions to the eclipse of the moon, but no extended descriptions of the ritual which had to be performed against the consequences of an eclipse are given there.646 Such a ritual is found in the Neo-Assyrian text CT 4, pl. 5-6. It describes for the twelve months of the year what the king had to do against the evil consequences ofa lunar eclipse.647 CT 51, 190648 is a namburbu, an apotropaic ritual for an individual directed against the evil consequences of, in this case, a lunar eclipse, and furthermore it is also directed at the god who sent the omen in order to obtain protection from him (in this case Sin).649 The first part of the Uruk ritual is described in BRM 4, 6; a small part of this text is duplicated in col. B of CLBT, pl. I. The last part of BRM 4, 6650 is duplicated by the first sixteen lines of BM 134701.651TherestoftheobverseofBM 134701, and the beginning of the reverse appear to describe the continuation of the ritual, but probably in rev. 10 ff. a passage begins, which belongs to the well-known lunar eclipse myth, described in the handbook against the evil utukku-demons (utukku /emnuti).652 Because the description of the ritual on the two tablets partly overlaps, it is unlikely that they belong together. However, in both texts the sign NAG is on one occasion written for GU7 ,6s3 and therefore it is not impossible that both tablets were written by the same writer. The obverse of BM 134701 is inscribed with great care, unlike the reverse, perhaps because the writer noticed that he had more than enough space on the tablet for the final part of the text. Nevertheless the interpretation of BM 134701 is often difficult,654 especially because to a large extent the beginning and the end of the lines are lost. Both texts must be dated to the Hellenistic period, and come from Uruk: the script is Late Babylonian; the texts mention the city ofUruk (Tiranna) and its temples, referring first to the Res-and Esgal-temples before they mention Eanna and the other temples,655 and Anu appears to be the predominant deity; also the name of the owner of BM 134701 begins with Anu, as is clear from the ( damaged) colophon. All this indicates that the text was written in the Hellenistic period, when Anu was the leading deity of the pantheon, and the Res-temple was the most important sanctuary in Uruk.656 However, as is clear from the incipits of the lamentations, the text must have had its roots in earlier periods. 657 64S See S.

657 Strangely enough in the BM card catalogue a date of composition has been given to BM 134 701. The 
note reads 'Uruk )12 B.C.'; it is probably written in the hand of the ex-Keeper (a non-cuneiformist), so we 
have no idea even whose suggestion this date is. 
BRM 4, 6 and BM 134701 contain in fact more than one version of the ritual, performed possibly at three or four places, and at the same time658: each version probably concentrates on the duties of one or more particular priests during the eclipse ritual. Therefore the text appears to be a programme or a set ofinstructions for the main priests of the ritual. 659 We will discuss the different versions here. II.7.1. The first version First, two rituals are performed, one during and one after the eclipse, in the gates of the temples of Uruk and on the main street. This first version is the most extensive description of the ritual, and very clearly expresses the most important function of the ) ritual: the neutralization of the evil consequences of a lunar eclipse. It also mentions most of the main performers of the ritual: the lamentation priests, a temple enterer (erib bfti), a priest addressed in the second person, the people of the land, and the exorcists.660 Where the text becomes clear, we find first general instructions to the lamentation priests, although the duties of the lamentation priest are specified only in the third version of the ritual66I: he has to perform 'the ritual procedure of the lamentation priest' (ne.pes saSUIIJ11GALA) during the eclipse. 662 This procedure consists of reciting several lamentations to the moon(god).663 Then the text mentions the incipits, in Akkadian, of several lamentations, which are clearly the Akkadian interlinear versions of bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian lamentations.664 We can distinguish eight units, which apparently are the first lines of the lamentations. The first unit665 perhaps contains a reference to the moongod Sin. It not only mentions Ningal, who is the wife of Sin, but also the wild cow. 666 According to our text the cow has left(?) the temple. This indicates that times are hard and that war if it occurs destroys cities and it peoples. It is believed by the Mesopotamians that difficult times must be explained by the fact that, for whatever reason, the gods have left their temples and that the inhabitants are consequently left on their own to suffer. The link with the moongod is clear: when the evil consequences of a lunar eclipse are not properly dealt with, disaster also strikes. The incipits of the other units which now follow667 confirm this interpretation; they 
are concerned with the destruction of cities and the consequences of it for the cult of 
the gods, a well-known theme in the Sumerian lamentations. Although this theme by 
itself has nothing to do with the eclipse of the moon, in the context of our text it is clear 
658 BRM 4, 6 contains four rituals, performed possibly at three places, according to G. Furlani, Riti, 263 ff. 659 Unlike the kettledrum ritual texts, the building ritual texts and the cultic calendar texts, which only describe the role of one particular priest (i.e. the lamentation priest), see Il.5.3. 660 BRM 4, 6, obv. 1-30, rev.31-37. 661 BRM 4, 6, rev.42ff. // BM 134701, obv.I ff. 662 Obv. 2, see also 17. 663 See obv. 14. 664 Cf.

For the latest edition see N. Veldhuis,A Cow of Sin (Library of Oriental Texts, volume 2), Groningen, 1991. 667 Obv. 5--6; 7-8; 9; IO; Ila; llb; 12-13. that the lamentations refer to the evil consequences of an eclipse. The composer of our text felt that it was appropriate to list the lamentation incipits in this context,668 Note the incipit in obv. 8, which reads: 'A storm arose, covered the face with dust', which in the duplicate CLBT, col. II, 8-9 is extended by the explanatory remark: 'Of Sin they said: "a storm arose, covere[ d] the face with dust"'. The commentator apparently sees a parallel here with the covering of the moon. After the enwneration of these lamentation incipits, the actual ritual begins. 669 First near the gates of the temples and on the main street, a garakku-brazieris set up by a priest who is addressed in the second person. Then the text reads: 'As soon as the eclipse begins', 67¡ clearly indicating that the Babylonians were able to calculate the moment when an eclipse would occur. 671 A temple enterer (erib biti) enters the scene, setting fire to the garakku-brazier.This fire must remain burning until the eclipse has ended. Until the end of the eclipse the lamentation priest must perform his 'ritual procedure', which may consist of performing the lamentations mentioned above, but may also refer to the lamentations mentioned in the third version of the ritual, discussed below. Then several proceedings are described, indicating that the moment of an eclipsed moon is a time of distress and mourning672: funerary offerings (kispu) are made,673 possibly because a parallel is seen here with the situation as at the end of the month, when the moon does not shine; we know that in the cult for the dead offerings for the deceased were usually made at the end of the month. The people of the land express their sorrow by removing their headdresses, covering their heads with clothing (lubaru), and uttering a special lament: 'May hardship, murder, rebellion and (the evil predicted by) the eclipse not reach Uruk, Res,Esgal, Baramag, Eanna and the (other) temples of Tiranna' .674This appears to be a regular apotropaic formula for averting all possible sorts of disasters for the city. Then seven soldiers utter the same formula. 675 668 According to T. Podella, $om-Fasten, Kevelaer, 1989, 45-49, the moon hasleft the people, and mourning is appropriate in this crisis situation when the gods have left them. 669 Obv. 14ft'. 670 Obv. 16, see also rev. 43. 671 1wo deposition documents from the Eanna-temple in Neo-Babylonian Uruk are known which are concerned with the use of a kettledrum in Uruk and Larsa during an expected eclipse, which however did not occur (A.

If this is the case, then we have here evidence of Emesal repertoire which was performed by persons other 
than the lamentation priest; note that this lament is also uttered by the sangu-priest (BRM 4, 6, rev. 38 ff.), 
contra J.A. Black, Eme-sal Cult Songs and Prayers, 23. From BRM 4, 6, rev. 48ff. // BM 134701, obv. 7ff.

As soon as the eclipse of the moon has come to an end, the fire on the garakku-brazier is put out with beer. The last line of the obverse refers to 'the next day' (ina 2-i u4-mu), when the building-master (itinnu)616 throws the garakku-brazierinto the river. This is strange, because after a cross.:line indicating tµat a new section begins,677 another ritual is described, again introduced by 'On the next day', which had to be performed on the day after the eclipse had ended. Perhaps the reference to the itinnubefore the cross-line indicates that he had to throw the brazier into the river on the next day, but before the end of the night vigil and before the pft babi-ceremony, 678 which was the first ceremony which was performed on the following day. 679In any case it is clear that for the composer of the text the removal of the ritual necessaries by the itinnubelongs to the ritual of the first day, but was performed on the second. In the ritual for the second day the gates, which had been placed under seal, are opened and a reed urigallu-standard,a magic circle of flour, and a white and black cord, which were in the temple, are thrown into the river by the 'you' -figure. Probably, the broken beginning of the text contained the instructions for placing these objects in the temple. All the temples and especially the Edumununna, the temple of Sm, are purified, the statue of Sm is dressed, and the holy water basins are set up. The following lines refer to the well-known lunar eclipse myth, attested in the handbook against evil utukku-demons, already mentioned above. Here the moon is threatened by seven hostile monsters. In our text the 'you'-figure must say: 'Verily, by the life of Anu and Enlil they (i.e. the seven monsters) are conjured' ,680after which the exorcists recite the Sumerian incantations 'Storm of jubilating water' and 'Evil utukku-demons'.Finally the magic circle of flour, the takpertu-purification necessaries and the garakku-brazierare thrown into the river. Note that the removing of all the ritual equipment has to be done again on the next day, although here by the 'you' -figure and not by the itinnuas at the end of the last section. It is strange that only here does the exorcist enter the scene, 681 unless the 'you' -figure, the leading priest in the ritual, is aiso an exorcist, which is possible, since it is he who is the most important officiant in rituals which are used to neutralize the evil affects of bad omens such as an eclipse. 682 Another cross-line follows. II.7 .2. The second version This time, another very short version of the ritual, introduced with 'alternatively' (sanis), is described, in which the actions of the sangu-priestsof the temples ofUruk at the time of an eclipse of the moon are discussed.683 They have to light the garakku-brazierin present authorin RA 91 (1997), 151, n. 13.

the gates of the temples in the district Tiranna and utter the same apotropaic formula as stipulated in the first version for the people of the land and the seven soldiers, until the eclipse had ended. II.7.3. The third version The third version of the ritual also describes what had to be done during an eclipse, but now concentrates fully on the lamentation priests; it is performed near the BARA.KI.BA.LAG the 'Dais, place (of) the Harp', and apart from the lamentation priests a 'you'.figure is also mentioned, as in the first version.684 Although the lamentation priests are mentioned twice before, in this version the duties of these priests are the main topic of interest, as is especially clear from the fact that several musical instruments, including the kettledrum, are mentioned. Also, only in this version does he actively participate in the ritual. 685 As we saw, in the first version the lamentation priest only receives a general instruction to perform his 'ritual procedure' during the eclipse, which is now specified in the third version. First, several musical instruments ( a bronze lJallJallatu-drum,a bronze manzu-drum, and a bronze kettledrum) are brought near the 'Dais, place (of) the Harp'. When the eclipse begins the lamentation priests put on a linen garment, cover their heads with torn lubaru-clothing,and 'raise' (na-su-u)686lamentations, wailings and mourning for the eclipsed moon. Then three heaps of flour are poured facing the kettledrum within the magic circle of flour. Ajar which is filled with 'tears of the holy tamarisk' and water is placed at the right side of these heaps of flour within the magic circle of flour, facing the eclipsed moon 'for the procedures of the lamentation priests' (a-na lam-nu suna-na hlGALA.MES). 687 Then the text describes lamentations which have to be recited during the several phases of the eclipsed rnoon.688 As soon as the eclipse has ended, the three main cult objects of the ritual, the kettledrum, the heaps of flour and the jar, are thrown into the river,just as in the first version, but here apparently this occurs on the same day as the other ritual proceedings, since no reference is made to the next day. We have seen that the kettledrum plays an important part in this third version of the ritual. Warding off the evil effects of a lunar eclipse can be achieved in different ways: by lamentation priests singing a lamentation, by the people of the land and soldiers or sangu-priests uttering an apotropaic formula, or by exorcists reciting an incantation,689 684 BRM 4, 6, rev. 42-55 // BM 134701, obv. 1-16.

688 BRM 4, 6, rev.48ff. // BM 134701, obv. 7ff. No songs or actions are outlined for when the maximal 
phase of the eclipse is passed and the moon begins to reemerge from the earth's shadow. Supported by 
eclipse reports from Babylon and Uruk this could indicate that lamentation probably took place only while 
the eclipses grew to their greatest extent. See the article of D. Brown and the present author in RA 9 l (1997), 
151 f., n. 14. For the eclipse reports from Babylon see now vol. V of the astronomical diaries on lunar and 
planetary texts. 
689 See M. Stol, in: Natural Phenomena, 258f. contra E. Cassin, La splendeur divine, 41 f., and id., Le 
semblable et le different, 1987, 259 ff.: according to Cassin the eclipse must be interpreted as a state of 'being 
silent1 of the moon-god. This matches well with the fact that during this period the king remains quiet in his 
palace. Furthermore there is a clear opposition between the behavior on the street and in the house: in the 
house one is supposed to be quiet, on the street one has to make noise and light fires. It symbolizes the chaos 
II. 7. The eclipse of the moon ritual Making loud noises and music are also effective.690 The use of the kettledrum during an eclipse is well attested. 691 The lamentation priest playing the kettledrum on the occasion of a solar(?) eclipse is attested in the Assur prayer VAT 13832.692 In a Neo-Assyrian letter to Esarhaddon from 671 B.C. the kettledrum is used during an eclipse of the moon (LAS I, 278693). Furthermore, we already mentioned two deposition documents from the Eanna-temple in Neo-Babylonian Uruk, where the kettledrum is mentioned in connection with a eclipse during the eighth year of Cyrus ( one that did not occur!). The Uruk eclipse text does not specifically say that the kettledrum was used for playing, or more specifically for accompanying the lamentation priests while they sing their lamentations, because for the composer of the text this is self-evident. The text does, however, describe the use of the instrument as a cult object, taking part in the ritual together with other cult objects. On the day of the eclipse it is placed (for playing) together with two other drums near the 'Dais, Place ( of) of the Harp'. It is used in a ceremony which involves three heaps of flour and a magic circle of flour, and at the end of the ritual, when it served its purpose, the kettledrum together with the heaps of flour and a jar were thrown into the river. Clearly the kettledrum was not only an instrument which was used to make music during a ritual in order to neutralize the evil effects of the lunar eclipse, but it also functioned as a cult object taking part in the ritual. Finally, in our discussion of the kettledrum we already referred to another Uruk ritual text, W 18728, where the consecrated lamentation priest and the chief singer of dirges are instructed to take off (pa{iirulit. "to loosen") the lubiiru-clothingbefore they can sit near the kettledrum, which appears to be in contrast with the eclipse ritual text, where the lamentation priests are deliberately wearing /ubiiru-clothing during the eclipse, while reciting the lamentations and kettledrum music is played.694 On BM 134701 this section of the text is separated from the following by a cross-line. 11.7.4. The fourth version Finally, in the last section another ritual is described in which, apart from the 'you'~ figure, the king appears to play an important part.695Unfortunately the beginning and end of the lines on part of the obverse and the complete reverse of BM 134701 are lost, which makes it difficult to give a comprehensive interpretation of the text. When the eclipse begins the king, wearing a tillu-uniform, is apparently in his palace. A person addressed in the second person performs a ceremony with a palm leaf and a multicolored cord; a similar cord was also mentioned in the first version of the ritual.696 of the eclipse of the moon as much as the silence in the houses, according to Cassin. Stol opposed by arguing 
that noise and fire will surely have had apotropaic purposes. Furthermore, there is no opposition: silence 
inside-noise outside, or: no fire inside -fire outside in our ritual text. Note however that in BM 13470 I, obv. 
17, when the eclipse begins, the king apparently is in his palace, which may refer to this opposition inside 
-outside (unfortunately the context of this passage is not clear).

Furthennore myrtle, eru-wood(?), and strong boxwood are mentioned and flour is used; while in BRM 4, 6 the magic circle of flour and heaps of flour are mentioned, in BM 134701 different types of flour (tappinnu, segussu) are recorded. The 'you'-figure sprinkles a temple after which its gate is sealed. Another ceremony concerning the multicolored cord follows. At the end of the obverse the king is involved in another ceremony. The reverse refers to a ceremony involving the cella and furthermore flour, utensils(?) and regular offerings are used.697The Res-temple, the Esgal-temple, the Baramab, the Eanna-temple and the other temples ofUruk, and also the bft piristi (a storage room for the ornaments and garments of the divine statues in the temple) and the Ubsukkinaku are involved in some kind of ceremony.698 The 'you'-figure surrounds the temples with a magic circle of tappinnu-flour,and he places the well and the great gates under seal. Something else is not placed under seal. 699 Finally a literary passage follows which refers to the lunar eclipse myth attested in CT 16, pl. 19ff.700 Presumably these lines had to be recited during the ritual, and they served the same purpose as the incantations which the exorcists had to recite at the end of the first version of the ritual: to ward off the evil consequences of the eclipse. More evidence for a lunar eclipse myth can be found in CLBT, pl. I, a text probably also from Uruk. From col. A only the end of the lines are preserved, which makes an interpretation very difficult, but col. B is better preserved; it contains a passage which duplicates BRM 4, 6,101 but which is then followed by what appears to be a part of an eclipse myth.702 The use of the verb qabu 'to say'703 perhaps suggests that this passage is a commentary containing quotations of a lunar eclipse myth with some commentary remarks. Note also phrases like 'He does not know' (ul i-de)104 and 'Or/Another possibility (sa-nis),105which support this interpretation.706 Some concluding remarks We can conclude that the lunar eclipse ritual was celebrated not only on the day the eclipse occurred, but was continued the next day. Furthermore, the ritual was perfonned by the priest, addressed in the second person, presumably the exorcist, but also other officiants took part, among whom the lamentation priest, the sangu-priestand the king are especially important Our Uruk ritual text does not present us with different eclipse rituals, but with four different versions of the same ritual.

Other festivals In this section several other festivals will be discussed, of which only little is known: a temple festival in Esabad, a so-called palm festival in Esagila, a t,aru-ritual in Esagila, a Greek festival, festivals for Istar of Babylon and for !star of Uruk, and a nocturnal festival celebrated in the Res-temple, and finally the ruler cults. II.8.1. A temple festival in Esabad In an Arsacid document from Babylon, dated year 154 A.E./218 S.E. (= 94 B.C.)707 a reference is made to a temple festival (isinnu biti)1DS of Esabad, the temple of Gula in Babylon, which was celebrated on day 25 of the third month, Sima.nu. The relevant passage reads: 6 2 1/2 GINana si-me I-en DOU.NITA SiSKUR

See also CT 56, 268, which mentions a festival ofBelet-Sippar on day 12 (of the third month?). As McEwan has noted, these documents are similar to the Hellenistic text, although the latter mentions sheep instead of barley and flour.715However, the little evidence that we have of isinnu in the Hellenistic period does not give us enough information to draw any conclusions as to the nature of this special festival. II.8.2. A palm festival In BM 32206 +,716 which describes ritual activities performed on the third and fourth day of the ninth month Kislimu in Babylon, several references are made to a festival in which date palm branches (libbi gisimmari) play an important part.717 On day 4 of Kis1Imu date palm branches are brought by boat from the temple of Ea within the Esagila-complex to the god Zariqu in a tent near the river bridge; then they are taken back by the boatmen to the temple of Ea, where temple personnel place them in various places in this temple and elsewhere in Esagila.718 During the activities of the fourth day, Enama elis is recited for Bel by the singer (niiru),719 and furthermore two lamentations are recited: the kettledrum (lamentation) UDAM KI AMUS 'It touches the Earth like a storm'720 and ELUM GUSUN 'Honored one, wild ox',,721 For this festival there is more evidence from the text BM 78076, a tablet dated to Darius, which describes days 2-15 ofKislimu in the Gula temple in Babylon, Esabad,722 Probably also referring to the palm festival is a small unpublished fragment of a temple ritual, BM 54901: although the context is not fully clear, the mentioning of several deities (Zariqu, Mustesir, dKAS.DIN.NAM), also attested in the Esabad and Esagila texts, strongly points in the direction of this festival. 723 Finally, the date palm branch is also used during the eclipse of the moon ritual in Hellenistic Uruk, as we now know from BM 134701.724 On the basis of textual evidence from Mesopotamia and Israel, Lambert made some suggestions as to the significance of this palm festival,725 He concluded that possibly 'there was an old and widespread custom in the ancient Near East of carrying branches of the palm (among others) at a harvest festival, of which we see differing relics in the Babylonian Kislev rites and the Jewish Feast ofTabemacles'.726 This festival is not attested elsewhere in texts from the Hellenistic period. 727 715 FAOS4, 163.

A barn-ritual Not much is known about the nature of a religious ceremony or ritual called barn,728 related to but not to be confused with the barn-container.729 It is well known from the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods,730 but not attested in the Hellenistic period, with the exception of a reference in an astronomical diary from Babylon: during the New Year festival on the eighth day ofNisannu the king takes part in a procession from Esagila to the alatu-templeand 'he performed the barn-ritual of ... [fo]r(?) Esagila in their presence' .731 The bit bare,732the barn-temple, is attested in a Hellenistic chronicle text from Baby.lon. 733 The barn-houseof the god Nabu is well-known from Assur734 and Babylon,735 but it is attested only twice in texts from Hellenistic Babylon, in a calendar text, where offerings were made on day 17 of Kis!Imu, 736 and in an astronomical diary. 737 11.8.4.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals ' 14 ¥¥¥ In that month I heard as follows: 15King Antiochus went victoriously into the cities ofMelubba (i.e. Egypt), the citizens [performed?] a :rwµ;r;fJand ritual acts according to Greek custom . . . [ ... ] '. This Greek festival probably celebrates Antiochus !V's victories of the first Egyptian campaign in 169 B.C. According to Polybius (XXX 26, 9) the spoils of this victory were displayed during a well-known festival held in Daphne, near Antioch, in 166 B.C. For this reason R.J. van der Spek argued that the festival referred to in the astronomical diary cannot be identified with the festival in Daphne.741 However, M.J. Geller suggested that the festival is indeed the festival of Daphne, but contrary to the classical sources celebrated in 169 rather than in 166 B.C .. 742 Important for us is that we have here a Babylonian source which refers to a Greek festival, celebrated by Greeks (16pu-li-fe-e;;;;,noliim) according to Greek custom C6ia.a-man-nu).743 II.8.5. Festivals for /star of Babylon and /star of Uruk 1\vo well-known deities are Uitar of Babylon and !star of Uruk. The cults of both deities must each have had their own series of temple rituals, but for the Hellenistic period only fragments are preserved. /star of Babylon: BM 32656 The cult oflstar of Babylon in her temple Eturkalamma 744is attested in a temple ritual fragment from Hellenistic Babylon dealing with the month Simiinu, BM 32656, which is published by A.R. George.745 The leading roles of the kurgarru and the assinnu demonstrate an especially close affinity with the so-called 'Love Lyrics Ritual', known from several Late Assyrian and Late Babylonian fragments. 746 There is evidence that the Divine Love Lyrics text was known up to the Arsacid period.747 The following cult proceedings are described 748: the preserved part of the ritual begins with day 3 of Simanu ( col.

prayer to Samas. This section is described elsewhere as a ritual procedure of the morning (nepesu sa seri). After a break the text continues with the last line of another prayer; this section is identified as the ritual procedure of the afternoon (nepesu sa m~lali), and could refer to days 3 to 8, since the next passage deals with day 9 ( col. IV). In the morning the kurgarru goes to the temple Emeurur (the temple of Nanaja at Babylon) and throws fruit at a wall behind which, according to George, lies the cella ofNanaja. In the afternoon more fruit is thrown at the cult-rooms oflstar of Babylon's temple. As George suggests, this fruit symbolizes aphrodisiacs, and must be connected with the patronage of sexual love oflstar and Nanaja.749 The text continues with the afternoon of day 15 of Simanu. The assinnu places a brick in the House of Lament (bit sipitte); after this the text describes several ceremonies, and the recitation of a Love Lyric by the assinnu follows. On day 16 the kurgarrfi.performs a similar ritual in a cultic place called the Equlu,750after which he proceeds to the Uras-gate, reciting perhaps another Love Lyric. Most of col. V is lost. /star ofUruk: TU 42 + We do not have much detailed information on the cult of !star of Uruk, although her name is often mentioned, both in cultic and non-cultic texts from the Hellenistic period. Her importance is illustrated not only by the fact that a new temple, Esgal, was built for her in the Hellenistic period, 751 but also by several fragments of a well-known myth, 'The Exaltation of Istar', which were copied during the Hellenistic period. 752 In TU 42 + a special festival for Istar is described, which is celebrated in Uruk during an unknown month. The obverse describes the preparations for a procession of !star; the ceremonies are similar to those, which for days 8 and 9 of the New Year festival (akttu) of Anu, during the seventh month Tasritu, are handed down to us (TU 39-40). The last part of the obverse and the whole of the reverse describe the actual procession of Istar from (probably) the Esgal to the akftu-temple,753 and resembles the Anu-procession described in KAR 132.754 The beginning of the text is lost. When the text becomes understandable, several deities, among whom are many goddesses, take up position ( tara~) in front oflstar, presumably in her cella in the Esgal-temple (which was probably mentioned in the lost beginning of the text), while the king prepares for the procession by putting on a ti/Ju-uniform. Meals are served to Istar and the other deities.755 i49 For fruit served during the divine meal as offering see III. 7. I.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals Then she is escorted to the first station of the procession, the room between the curtains (birft siddi), and again the gods take up position in front of her. 756 After an offering and a libation by a priest, and a purification of the king and others who are present, first the Scepter of Kingship, and then Istar herself go to the next station of the procession, the Dais of Destinies (parak sfmatz).757 The procession of !star and the Scepter of Kingship together with the other gods then makes its way to the procession-boat (gi~MA.GURs).758 After they have arrived at the wharf (arammu),the god Usmft and the king lead !star and the Scepter of Kingship into the courtyard of the akftu-temple, where !star takes her place on the Great Dais (BARA.GAL), and the other gods follow.759Presumably when all the gods are in the courtyard, Usmii and the king lead !star and the Scepter of Kingship into the last station of the procession, !star's cella (papa/Ju)in the akftu-temple.76¡ The final lines of the text describe other gods following !star into her cella, and preparations for a ceremony in her cella, which include setting up several cult objects, such as Anu's armchair, chariots, a kettledrwn, a carrying pole, and offering tables.761 Because this festival for !star is not known from other ritual texts, 762 it is difficult to establish the function and importance of TU 42 +.It is clear, however, that the text only contains part of the ritual, and at least one more tablet must have been used to describe the rest of the festival, probably including the journey back to, in this case, the Esgal. temple in Uruk, just as Anu returned during the New Year festival. The importance of this ritual for !star is underlined by the fact that the king takes part in the ritual. Clearly the text provides us with no more than a glimpse of the !star cult in Uruk, paralleled as it is by the Ann cult of which we know more, especially owing to the New Year texts. It is interesting that the text mentions the exorcists, the lamentation priests, the singers and a temple enterer (erib bfti),163 but there is no reference to a leading priest, addressed in the second person. This is not unusual in the temple ritual texts which belong to the large series of temple rituals covering the whole year, and TU 42 + apparently belongs to this series. II.8.6. TU 41: a nocturnal festival in the Res-temple As we already saw,764an important source for the good-functioning of the temple ceremony (salam bfti) and the vigil ( bajjiitu)is the Uruk temple ritual text TU 41, which describes a nightly ritual for days 16 and 17 of perhaps the tenth month Tebetu.765 The 756 Obv. 26'-27'.

beginning (probably mentioning the pl~ce where, and the moment when, the festival was held) and end of the text are not preserved. When the text becomes understandable, the Scepter and a lamp in the shape of a shoe (senu), which symbolizes Nusku, god of light and fire,766 descend to the Grand Courtyard and take up position facing Anu, who is in his cella, and where he remains during the entire ritual. The Scepter enters and Papsukkal, Nusku and Usmu go and sit in the courtyard of Anu. Then the Shoe enters the bed-chamber of the goddess Antu, the 'House with the golden bed' (E.NIR E gi!NlJ GUSKIN saAn-tu 4)167 and is placed upon a footstool, while the goddesses Marat-Anu and Marat-Uruk sit in the courtyard of Anu. An evening meal is served but not cleared away, and the gate, in contrast with a normal cul tic day, is not closed because the vigil continues the entire night. 768 Then a description follows of the ceremonies which were held during this vigil, including several offerings, libations, and recitations in the sanctuary on the top of the temple tower of the Res-temple. 769Note that most of these proceedings are performed by a priest addressed in the second person (see below). The ritual continues with a procession with the Torch (gizillii),770that is a divine Torch, upon which the washing of the mouth ceremony (mfs pi) has been performed.7 71 First a lumabbu-priest lights this Torch. The chief temple enterer (erib bfti rabu), accompanied by exorcists, lamentation priests and singers, leads the Torch down from the temple tower, and he enters the Grand Courtyard by the Holy Gate, where the torch takes up position in front of Anu. After a container is broken(?) in front of Anu, the procession of the Torch, now led by the temple enterer together with three gatekeepers, Papsukkal, Nusku, Usmu, and Messagunug, proceeds to the cella of Antu. Again a container is broken(?), now in front of Antu. The next station. of the procession is Ubsukkinaku: an ox is killed near the Dais of Destinies, a brushwood pile (abru) is kindled from the Torch, and the right and left side of the pile are touched with the shoulder of the slaughtered ox.772 Then the procession leaves the Ubsukkinaku through the Grand Gate (KA.MAB), and the four gods encircle the temple, after which they re-enter, each god through his own gate: Papsukkal through the Grand Gate, Nusku through the Great Gate (KA.GAL), and Usmu through the Main Gate (KA.SAG).773 Although the text makes no reference to the Torch and Messagunug returning into the temple, this must have taken place as is clear from what follows. 774The three gods remain at their gates until dawn and temple enterers ( erib bfti) light brushwood piles from the Torch in front of them. Then fires in the other temples ofUruk are kindled from the Torch by sangu-priests and temple enterers, after which they perform 'the good.766 See my comments on TU 41, obv. 2 in the Appendix.

functioning of the temple' ceremony (saliim bfti) in the temples. After more brushwood piles are kindled at the gates of the temples, and two blessings are recited, the Torch and Messagunug return to the courtyard of Antu. The Torch is extinguished by an exorcist. Messagunug remains in the Ubsukkinaku and Adad, S1n, Sama¤ and Belet-ilI in the courtyard until daybreak. The people of the land kindle brushwood piles in their homes, serve a banquet for Anu, Antu and the other gods, and recite the same blessing as before. 775 The city guardians kindle brushwood piles in the streets and crossroads, and they also plant standards left and right of the city gates. Brushwood piles will bum here until dawn. 776 There is no mention of closing the gate at the end of the night, 777 but in the morning of day 1 7, 40 minutes after sunrise, the gate is opened again and the vigil ends. 778 The main and second meals of the morning are served for Anu, Antu and the other gods. After censers have been filled, and more offerings and a recitation by the singers are performed (among which is the lamentation ELUM GUSUN 'Honored one, wild ox' 779) Adad, Sin, Samas, Messagunug and Belet-ilI are led into the room between the curtains (birft siddt).1 80 The rest of the text is lost. Some concluding remarks This text is especially interesting because it gives us more detailed information about the proceedings during the night vigil than the other sources which were discussed elsewhere. 781However, the ritual which is described in TU 41 was probably held for a special occasion and the different ceremonies celebrated during the nocturnal ritual cannot be used as a standard schedule for a normal vigil. This is confirmed by the appearance of the priest addressed in the second person; this 'you' -figure is not attested in the texts belonging to the large series of temple ritual text covering the whole year. We do know of the 'you'-figure, especially from other occassional rituals, which belong to the corpus of the lamentation priest (the kettledrum ritual and the building ritual). 782The most likely candidate for the 'you' -figure in TU 41 is the exorcist; he is mentioned more often than the other participants in the ritual. Moreover we know that he participated in many temple rituals performing all sorts of ritual activities.783 II.8.7.

a special cultforthe king and his family; the royal family appears to have been the object of offerings in the Babylonian temples. In this paragraph we will discuss the evidence for this cult and examine whether it can be connected with the Hellenistic ruler cults. Evidence from Hellenistic Babylonia Susan Sherwin-White and Amelie Kuhrt have extensively discussed the so-called ruler cults in the Seleucid empire. 785They emphasize the distinction which has to be made between on the one hand a centrally imposed and organised state cult, instituted by Antiochus III for himself and former rulers (ne6yovot), together with a separate royal cult of his wife Laodice, and on the other hand civic ruler cults, established by the Greek cities on their own initiative without direct orders from the king. 786 As far as Babylonia is concerned, they argue, there is no evidence of any ruler cult (state nor civic) for áseleucid kings. There are many references in the Hellenistic text corpus from Babylonia to offerings, prayers or dedications 'for the life of the king'. In an earlier article Sherwin-White discussed these passages787 and concluded that they constitute not a new development but an old Babylonian practice, which was only concerned with the physical and mental well-being of the king. Furthermore, the practice of offering before the statues of ruling and deceased kings cannot be connected with ruler cults, because deification of the king is not implied here. Also, offerings made by or on behalf of the king only indicate the participation of the king in the temple cult, and have nothing to do with a royal cult of the Seleucid monarchs. Let us examine the Babylonian evidence of the Hellenistic period. Uruk An Uruk building inscription788from 244 B.C. dedicates the reconstruction work on the Res-temple complex of Anu to the reigning kings. Line 15 reads: a-na bul-tu saIAn-ti.'-i-ku-su u ¥se-lu-ku LUGAL.MES DU-us-ma u-sak-lil 'ISfor the life of Antiochus and Seleucus, the kings, he built (all this) in its entirety'. Similarly, in another Uruk building inscription from the year 202/1 B.C.;789 lines 10-12: a-na mub-bi [bul-tu sa]lAn-ti-'-i.ku-su LUGAL b[e-el-ia] te-me-en-na-su-nu-ti SUMUN DAGAL' 10... for the sake of the [life of] IIAntiochus, the king, my lord, 121 have extended their old foundations'. Another example is an Arsacid fragment, a contract from Uruk, which records the dedication of a slave girl 790: 78S From Samarkhand to Sardis, 116ff.; 202ff.

'. More examples are known.792 They clearly show that the phrase ana (mu!J!Jz) bul{U means 'for (the sake of) the (physical and mental) health of', and is in no way different from similar phrases use in pre-Hellenistic times. So far we can agree with Susan Sherwin-White and Amelie Kuhrt. We already discussed Hellenistic legal documents from Uruk concerning prebend shares (all dated to the second century B.C.}, which refer to offerings brought up 'to (the table of) the statues of the kings'. 193Unlike the passages discussed above, these references are unusual. We know that on rare occasions, particularly during the Ur III-period, statues _of deified kings received offerings, but from the Old Babylonian period on deified kings are unknown in Mesopotamia. In the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods the statue of the legendary Sargon of Akkad was also honored with special offering gifts, 794 but note that in these texts Sargon was usually referred to by name, unlike the Hellenistic kings. The question is whether the text passages from Hellenistic Uruk refer to statues of living kings of the Seleucid dynasty, or to statues of former rulers like Sargon. As van der Spek noted, there are parallels for deified kings honored as O'Vvvaoi {}eoi in native temples.795 Also, phrases in Hellenistic cuneiform sources like the ana (mu!J!Ji) bul,u-examples mentioned above (but also those attested in the astronomical diaries from Babylon discussed below) all refer to living Seleucid kings. We may therefore safely assume that the statues are also ofliving Seleucid rulers. For now there is no hard evidence which connects the Hellenistic text passages with a ruler cult practice in Hellenistic Uruk, instigated by a Seleucid king, but, in view of 791 According to G.J.P.

the fact that suddenly in cuneiform sources of the second century B.C. in Uruk offerings for the statues of rulers show up, seeing a connection is tempting. Babylon From Baby1on we have one example in a chronicle text. Chronicle 13b796 states that during the reign of king Seleucus III the administrator (satammu) ofEsagila established offerings within Esagila a-na dEN u dGASAN-ia u DINGIR.MES GAL.MES ua-na dul-lu(?) sa rse[-lu ]-ku 'LUGAL, u A.MES-su 'for Bel and Belfija and the great gods and for the rituaJ(?) of Seleucus, the king, and his sons' ( obv. 7-8). The phrase used here is slightly different: the offerings are made for DN 1 and DN2 and the great gods 'and for' (u ana) the ritual (if this reading is correct) of the king and -his sons, indicating not a separation,797but a close connection between on the one hand the gods and on the other.hand the king and his family. The latter are not seen as gods (therefore no dinger [= god] sign is used) but as s1,1perhumans. Here offerings are made 'for the gods and for the ritual(?) of the king', while in pre-Hellenistic times offerings were made to the gods to ensure the well-being of the king (using the phrase: ana DN ana bul{i sarri/ana baliit napsiiti sarri 'to the gods for the life/well-being of the king'). We frequently encounter a very similar expression in the astronomical diaries from Babylon.798They start during the reign of Antiochus III and continue into the Arsacid period. They all deal with offerings made in Esagila for Bel, Belfija, sometimes Istar of Babylon, the great gods 'and for the life' (u ana bulfz) of the king, usually performed by a high military or temple official, although the broken context is often a problem. ~ee, ~or ex~ple, this passage from the ~rsacid period (n?. -107, 108 B.C.): [anavdENJ dGASAN-ia, DINGIR.MES GAL.MES u ana bul-tu sa LUGAL LUG AL.MES DU us-kin-nu 'He (i.e. an officiaJ from Subartu, who was the substitute of Orodes, the chief kumar of the temples) perf9rmed (the offerings) [for Bel], Belfija, the great gods and for the life of the king of kings, ( and) prostrated himself'. It is important to observe that the connecting word u 'and' (often u ana 'and for'), attested in chronicle 13b, is also used in most of these passages in the astronomical diaries (in fact, it is only missing when the tablet is damaged), but is unknown in texts from pre-Hellenistic times. On two occassions (nos. -187 and -178) the offerings are also made for the king's wife and sons. We have three examples (nos. -171, -140, -107) in which the offerer prostrates himself (sukenu) after having offered to the great gods and for the life of the king. The verb sukenu is used to express worship of or submission to a deity, although it can also be used between human beings, like subject and ruler.799 The evidence at least leaves open the possibility that perhaps from Seleucus III on in the Esagila-temple of Babylon a special royal cult was practised side by side with the cult for the great Babylonian gods. The passages known from Babylon are all very 796 A.K. Grayson, Chronicles,283f. See also 11.4.5.2.

II. Ceremonies, rituals and festivals similar in context and formulation. A clear connection is made between the gods and the king (sometimes including his wife and sons) by the word 'and' (u). Hence, all these fragments suggest that after this time the kings received a special status. Furthermore, why do we find in many of these passages a reference to the ilani rabuti 'the great gods'? This may very well be an attempt to emphasize the difference between the 'real' gods and the superhuman king. Some concluding remarks As far as Uruk is concerned we must conclude that, for now, there is no evidence which suggests that the phrase 'for the life of the king' in the examples from the Hellenistic period deals with anything other than the physical and mental well-being of the king, just as in pre-Hellenistic times. However, the passages which refer to offerings brought before the statues of the kings are unusual; the possibility of a local ruler cult for Seleucid kings during the second century B.C. cannot be excluded. For Hellenistic Babylon we have attempted to show that the cuneiform sources possibly contain references to a royal cult. The fact that in the astronomical diaries of Babylon the ana bu/tu-expression is used only from Antiochus III on (and not before him), is striking. Because a reference to the king's wife and sons is sometimes made in this phrase, and yet for the state cult of Antiochus III only his wife, and never his sons are included, Sherwin-White and Kuhrt may be right in assuming that the Babylonian references cannot be connected with this state cult. However, it does not exclude the possibility that these references constitute a local royal civic cult in Babylon. The evidence from chronicle 13b suggests that such a local cult in Babylon may have been practised at least from the time of Seleucus III on. Whether it was initiated by the Babylonians or by the Seleucid king remains unclear. This does not mean, however, that the kings became top gods. As van der Spek already stated: 'Ruler-cult or dynastic cult did not imply that the "deified" kings were treated in the same way as Olympian or other traditional gods. Ruler-cult was a method of honouring one or more kings in a superhuman manner, but it did not mean that these kings became the colleagues of Zeus or Marduk'. sooThe cuneiform sources may reflect an interpretatio-Babylonica of a Greek cult: the scribes of Babylon simply used the old ana bul{i-phrase to express the Hellenistic view on superhuman kingship. soo BiOr 42 (1985), 559--00. III. THE DIVINE MEAL 
III.1. Introduction One important element of the cult is the offering. An offeringI is a series of cul tic acts which exist in almost all known religions. One brings something from a profane or secular place into a holy or sacred place, kills or destroys it, or eats it in the presence of others, in order to make a connection with the divine. In Mesopotamian rituals the offering is predominant. In his article 'The origins of the sacrificial cult: new evidence from Mesopotamia and Israel', W.W.Hallo examines the origin of the offering_ in Israel and Mesopotamia2: in Mesopotamia and in Israel similar conceptions of the origins of the offering practice existed, namely to sanctify the act of consumption by the deity. However, the cult and concept of offering of the Hebrews and the Mesopotamians evolved in entirely different directions. Since in Mesopotamia the ideology of the ritual is never expressed, the myths are used to explain the function of the offering3: there we find that mankind was created to take over the hard work from the gods and provide the gods with food and drinks. Since the gods needed food just like humans, offerings usually consisting of food, drinks and aromatics (fumigation) were presented in front of the statues of the gods. The cultic meals provided for this need. Ali in the Greek and Roman world the principle of do ut des (I give, in order that you give) was important: one has to give the deities the honours they deserve, and in return the deities will protect the state and give prosperity. The 'feeding of the gods' remained the most important purpose of the divine meal in Mesopotamia. Although the foods and drinks offered were re-distributed after the offering ceremony to priests, temple personnel and others, an official cult maintained up to the end of Mesopotamian civilization the fiction 'that the divine meal was consumed by the gods, or rather their statues, and that the offerings served no other purpose. In texts from Mesopotamia we do not find a clear definition of an offering. However, a general description of the offering practice in the temples of Hellenistic Uruk is known. As we already saw,4 in TU 38 a list is presented, which appears to be an attempt to present a complete description of the regularly recurring offerings and ceremonies during the cultic year in Uruk. Obv. 35=38 mentions loaves and date cakes which are meant for several offerings and ceremonies. The list starts off with two groups of general 1 I will take W.G. Lambert~advice (in: OLA 55 [1993), 191) and avoid the tenn 'sacrifice' (usually referring to the killing of an animal), which in modem usage 'is too dependent on Biblical institutions and concepts to be a suitable vehicle to express ancient Mesopotamian practices'. Relevant for the study of the Babylonian offering practice in the Hellenistic period are especially G. Furlani, Sacrificio,F.Blome,Opfermaterie,and G.J.P.McEwan,FAOS4, 166ff.

III. The divine meal offering gifts: the travel provisions for the procession of (the statues of) the gods ($idftu iliim),5 and the monthly guqqu-offerings, 6 apparently here mentioned instead of ginu or sattukku, perhaps because further on in the list the essesu-festivals, with which they are connected, are mentioned. At the end of the list a third group, the offerings of the kliribu-citizen, and a fourth group, the additional offerings, which the king had to perform (tardit sarri), are mentioned. 7 No attempt has been made to enumerate all the specific offerings; instead they are summarized in four larger groups: one specific group of offerings performed by priests for the gods when they leave the temple for a procession, one general group of offerings performed by priests for the gods when they are in the temple, and two specific groups of offerings for the gods offered by kliribu-citizenand the king. As for the divine meal, a sequence of events can be distinguished. At the place chosen as an offering site, an offering table is set up, and water is brought in for washing. Then the table is arranged. Meat, liquids and sometimes fruit are served, and fumigation and purifications are performed. The offering side is consecrated. Behind closed curtains recitations are performed, after which the table is cleared away. Here the divine meal ends. Although not necessarily in this order, these are the basic elements of the divine meal. In this chapter we will first describe which cultic meals are attested in texts from Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon. Then we will describe the different elements of the divine meal. 111.2. Cultic meals The income of the temple, which consisted of agricultural and meat products, was not only used as payment for the priests, administrators and other personnel in the temple, or stored away for future need. Most importantly, it served as food which was offered daily in front of the divine statues in the temple. In the temple ritual texts from Hellenistic Uruk and Babylon the cultic meals are described extensively. In this section we will first examine which cultic meals are attested. Then we will discuss TU 38, a text describing in detail the daily offering practice in the Res-temple and other sanctuaries of Hellenistic Uruk, and one which is therefore important for our understanding of the cultic meals. IIl.2.1. Terminology In the Hellenistic period 8 naptanu and tardennu9are known as the formal main and second ritual meals offered on a stand in front of the statues of the gods in the temples; they were prepared and served by priests during various ceremonies and rituals.

combined use of main and second meal is also known in Neo-Babylonian Uruk.1¡ In the Hellenisticá temple ritual texts, both meals are used during the daily offering practice in Uruk,11the New Year festival in Uruk,12 the Uruk night vigil festivitiesl3 and the festival for !star of Uruk.14 Also during the festivities of the month Kis1Imu in Babylon meals are served.15 No meals are mentioned in the ritual texts of the lamentation priest, i.e. the kettledrum ritual and the building ritual texts. Normally four meals were present~d during the day: the main and second meal in the morning (naptan rabu sa seri, tardennu sa seri)16 and the main and second meal in the evening ((naptan) rabu u tardennu sali"lat).17Sometimes additional indications for the times of the meal are given, e.g. a main and second (meal) of the (last) double hour of the day (GAL-u utar-den-nu.Mbi-ru U4-mu),18or in the afternoon: on the fourth day of the New Year festival of the month Nisannu in Babylon, after a second meal in the late afternoon ([EGIR tar ]-den-nu sa ki-i~ u4-mu)was served, Enuma elis was recited.19 Usually however the texts simply refer to these meals as naptanu and tardennu. Other words for 'meal' e.g. lilatu, makiilu, qeritu, nubattu and takultu are, as far as the Hellenistic period is concerned, rare and usually only attested in (Emesal) incantations and prayers.20 The main and second meal are described extensively in the temple ritual text TU 38. 10 See the Late Neo-Babylonian Uruk ritual textLKU, no. 51, where ceremonies for the whole year involving 
the goddesses Belet-lia-Uruk, U~r-amassu and Aska'itu in the Eanna-temple are described (passim in this 
text).

III. The divine meal IIl.2.2. TU 38 TU 38 contains ritual instructions for the daily offerings in the temples of Anu, Istar, Nanaja and the other gods in Hellenistic Uruk, and dates from the beginning of the second century B.C.21 It describes very explicitly and in detail the immense quantity of products which were brought into the temples for the regular offerings (ginu),22They were used for the four daily meals. A main meal followed by a second meal were served in the morning; they took place at the beginning of the day when the temple was opened. Another main and second meal were served in the evening and apparently took place before the temple was closed. liquids Lines obv. 1-16 ofthe text begin to describe all sorts ofliquids: barley-beer, labku-beer, nasu-beer, zarbiibu-beer,milk, and drawn wine, and first quality beers, which were brought in containers (sappu), containers used as libation bowls (maqqu), and vases (tilimtu)for the four daily meals to the table of Anu. For the main meal of the morning we first find eighteen sappu-containers, which are not used as libation bowls, with their contents (obv. 1-5): 6 golden sappu-containers  barley-beer  5 golden sappu-containers  labku-beer  1 golden sappu-container  niisu-beer  l golden sappu-container  zarbiibu-beer  l alabaster sappu-container  milk  4 golden sappu-containers  drawn wine  For the second meal of the morning and the main and second meal of the evening the list is the same, with exception of the alabaster sappu-containerwith milk, which is not served during the evening meals (obv. 6-7). The first section of the text ends with 5 golden .sappu-containers with a zarfnu-stand of algamisu-stone (obv. 8). After a cross-line, five sappu-containers, which are used as libation bowls, with their contents are listed ( obv. 9-16): l sappu-container used as libation bowl barley-beer 1 sappu-container used as libation bowl labku-beer l sappu-containerused as libation bowl niisu-beer l sappu-container used as libation bowl drawn wine l sappu-container used as libation bowl zarbiibu-beer(?) Then a sappu-container with wine from Izallu and 4 tilimtu-vasesare mentioned ( obv.11-á 16), after which a second cross-line follows, indicating the end of the second section. The 5 sappu-containers used as libation bowls mentioned in the second section are additional to the 18 containers mentioned in obv. 1-5, as is clear from obv. 1: e-lat sap.21 See the introduction of the text in the Appendix. 22 See III. 7 .2. pi.MES .Mma-aq-qa-ne-e'in addition to the sappu-containers belonging to the libation bowls'. This is what distinguishes section one from section two. As we will see, similar distinctions (indicated by elat 'in addition to/not included are') are given throughout the text. Although Anu is mentioned together with Antu in obv. 16 (the context is not clear since the end of obv. 15 and 16 is damaged), it is evident that the first and second section (obv. 1-16) are only concerned with Anu (cf. obv. 2; see also the reference to the cella of Anu in obv. 12 and probably also in obv. 9). This is also confirmed by the fact that the following section, obv. 17-18, is concerned with Antu, !star and Nanaja: 14 golden sappu-containers  first quality beer  Antu  12 golden sappu-containers  (first quality beer)  !star  10 golden .¤appu-containers  (first quality beer)  [Nanaja]  In addition to these sappu-containers obv. 19 mentions golden sappu-containers used during the offering service of the whole year for the other gods living in Uruk. And, separated by another cross-line, obv. 20 (the fourth section) refers to 2 more golden sappu-containerswith travel provisions for the procession of the gods (#dftu iliini), and 2 tilimtu-vases.We will have more to say about these travel provisions shortly. ~idftu iliini The travel provisions of the gods are mentioned directly after the section concerned with the liquids (obv. 1-19), but separated by a cross-line, and directly before the section concerned with flour used to make loaves, also separated by a cross-line (obv. 21-47). So, what did they consist ofl $idftu was written syllabically and with the Sumerogram NINDA.KASKAL 'bread for the road' (Akkadian akal barriini23) which gives us some idea what these travel provisions, at least originally, consisted of. In the first millennium bread or flour (qemu) must also have been a main component, next to beer, chick-peas and barley; the examples of flour connected with #dftu in Neo-Babylonian administrative texts confirm this.24The Hellenistic text discussed here, TU 38, also mentions the travel provisions once more ( obv. 3 6); ~idrtu iliini is listed here together with the offerings and ceremonies, for which large(?) loaves and date cakes are distributed. Exactly the same list of offerings and ceremonies, but without ~iditu iliini, is mentioned in rev. 36--38, but here oxen and sheep meat are distributed. So, apparently, in this case meat did not belong to the travel provisions of the gods. However, in a prebend sale of the erib bftiltu ( office of the temple enterer) a share in the mutton for the ~id'ftuiliini was also part of the sale.25 23 Cf. the lexical list Proto-Diri,374f.: NINDA.KASKAL.[LA] =' ,ri-di-[tum], a-lea-al bar-[ra-nim]. For the gods traveling see J. van Dijk, in: RIA3 (1957-), s.v. 1Gott', ¤4: 1Gotterreisen1¥ 24 Cf. CAD,$, 172-73 sub c-g, and for the Nee-Babylonian period 173 sub h. zs J. Oppert, J. Menant, Doc.jur., no. 2 (5, 7, 12, 20). L.T. Doty will publish two texts mentioning sales of rights to ,riditu iliini, NCBT 1963 and NCBT 1975, in YOS 20; apparently they also consist of mutton, cf. L.T.Doty, CAHU, 198. The ,riditu ilani is also attested in the ritual fragment Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 14, 5' (see my comments on TU 44, I, 8 in the Appendix). III. The divine meal flour and loaves Lines obv. 21-35 (the fifth section) are concerned with barley flour and emmer flour ( explicitly called flour in obv. 25), which the miller has to deliver every day to the bakers for the regular offerings (ginu, obv. 22), and are used to provide the loaves and cakes for the four divine meals of Anu, Antu, !star and Nanaja, and all the other gods in Uruk. 26 The amount of flour is described very accurately: the contents of 1 puru-bowl = 3 kor and 3 panu of barley and [ emmer] flour= (in sexagesimal ciphers) 1,48 seah (sutu) =(in decimal ciphers) 108 seah, in accordance with a fixed standard for the regular offerings: the seah-measure of 10 manu (ina gi¤BANsci10 MA.NA). This is then further specified: the 108 seah flour consist of 81 seah barley flour and 27 seah emmer flour. This means that, by the Neo-/Late-Babylonian standard of 1 seah =6 litres, the immense amount of 648 litres of flour was brought into the temple every day of the year, i.e. 486 litres of barley flour and 162 litres of emmer flour.27 á The flour was used by the bakers to make 243 ~ibtu-loaves. Of these loaves 168 were. supplied for the four daily offerings (obv. 26-33) in front of Anu, Antu, Istar, Nanaja, for some divine symbols and for the ziqqurrat, as follows: 8 ~ibtu-loaves  the main meal of the morning  Anu  8 ~ibtu-loaves  second meal of the morning  Anu  7 ~ibtu-loaves  the main meal of the evening  Anu  7 ~ibtu-loaves  the second meal of the evening  Anu  30 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  Antu  30 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  !star  30 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  Nanaja  12 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  the seat of Anu and the household god  of the cella of Antu  4 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  the 2 tiaras of Anu  16 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  the ziqqurrat and the household god  of the ziqqurrat  16 ~ibtu-loaves  the four meals  the wings(?) of the cella of Anu and Antu  The 30 loaves for áAntu, !star and Nanaja clearly must have been divided in the same manner as those of Anu: 8 loaves each for the main and second meal of the morning, and 7 each for the main and second meal of the evening. After specifying these 168 loaves there are 75 loaves for the four daily meals left ( distinguished by elat) for the other gods from Uruk in their temples, making a total of243 loaves (obv. 34-35). In addition to (e/at) these 243 loaves the text also mentions large(?) loaves (~i.ba-at rab-bu-u) and the date cakes (a-kal ma-ak-kas), which are used for the travel provisions for the processions of the gods and also during some other ceremonies and offerings (obv. 35-38): the guqqu-offerings, the essesu-ceremonies,the opening-of the gate ceremonies, the clothing ceremonies, the holy water (basin) ceremonies, the night 26 See G. Furlani, Riti, I ff. 21 Cf. RAcc., 81, n. 4. vigil ceremonies, the brazier ceremonies, the rites of the divine marriage, the offerings of the karibu-citizen and the additional offerings of the king (tardftu sam).28 It is not unlikely that the products mentioned next (obv. 38-43: red cakes (siimutu), takkasu-cakes, 1200kusfpu-loaves, pressed oil, and ma~batu-flour) refer to the additional offerings of the king. In the almost identical list in rev. 36-38 (in a section which is concerned with meat) these additional offerings are also the last to be mentioned, but here they are not specified further.29 The fifth section ends with a reference to two recitation-incipits; these recitations have to be performed by the miller and the baker. Dates.figs, raisins, bi~~a~iitu-cake The last section of the obverse (obv. 48-50) describes the amount of choice dates, Dilmun-dates, figs, raisins, which 'in addition to bi~~~iitu-cakes(?) and the table: arrangement (tabnztu)' (obv. 49) are needed for the four meals, and which are served to Anu, Antu, Istar,Nanaja and the other gods ofUruk. The total of these products amounts to (in sexagesimal ciphers) I, 48 seah or (in decimal ciphers) 108 seah, i.e. 648 litres, precisely as much as the amount of 648 litres of flour mentioned in the fifth section ( obv. 21 ff.). meat The reverse of the tablet is concerned with meat deliveries for the regular offerings (ginu),30 especially oxen and sheep. In total 13 sections are indicated by cross-lines. The introduction (rev. 1-3) states that these regular offerings will be served daily throughout the year to Anu, Antu, !star, Nanaja and the other gods residing in the Res-temple, the Esgal-temple and the Esarra-temple (the sanctuary, also called Baramab, on the temple tower of Anu). Note that the Eanna-temple and the other temples of Tiranna (= Uruk) are addressed later (rev. 35). Lines rev. 4-9 are concerned with the main meal of the morning. Then the text refers to the incipit of a blessing and perhaps to a prayer (rev. 1~12), which had to be recited during the slaughtering by the butcher ( see rev. 8-9 and 11 ), after which the second meal of the morning is described (rev. 13-17). After this follow the main (rev. 18-20) and second (rev. 21-23) meals of the evening. The meat-products for these four daily meals are31: main meal of the morning (rev. 4-9) second meal of the morning (rev. 13-17) 7 first-quality sheep 6 fat, pure sheep 1 kii/u-sheep suitable for the ginu 1 (kiilu-) sheep suitable for the ginu 1 full-grown ox 5 fat sheep of lesser quality 1 suckling calf 1 full-grown ox 2s For this list see also II.

First, in the bit mabazzat, an unknown room in the sanctuary,32 10 sheep are slaughtered 'for Anu and Antu, of the heaven, (for) Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn (and) Mars, (at?) sunrise and the appearance of the moon, to be offered as a voluntary(?) offering in the bit mabazzat'. Secondly (rev. 32-34), every month on day 16 in the Baramab (the name of the temple on the temple tower of Anu), 10 sheep are again offered for Anu and Antu of the heaven, and for Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Mars, the sun and the moon (here referred to as 'the seven planets'), this time on the occassion of the cleansing of the hands ceremony (te-bi-ib-tu4 SUI!)exactly as on day 16 of the tenth month Tebetu.33 While so far the text has been concerned with offerings in the Res-temple, the Esgal.temple and the Esarra-temple, in the beginning of the next section sheep are mentioned as offerings in the Eanna-temple and the other temples of Uruk (rev. 35). Furthermore the list already mentioned in obv. 36--38 is repeated, indicating here that oxen and sheep are also used for these offerings and ceremonies. The fact that the 32 See mxcomments on rev. 31 in the Appendix. 
33 See my earlier remarks on this passage in 1.2 and in the introduction of 11.3. 
travel provisions of the gods are not mentioned here indicates that meat products were not used for these provisions. Also, we already noticed above that the products which are probably used for the last offerings mentioned in the list, the additional offerings of the king ( obv. 38 f.), are not further specified here. Finally, as discussed elsewhere, at the end of the section the list is explained as a description of the Urukaean cults.34 In a new section the text mentions a few restrictions on the meat-menu of four specific gods: Sakkan, Ningublaga, Belet-~eri and Ereskigal (rev. 40-42). 35 The text ends with a most interesting colophon (rev. 43-50). 36 Some concluding remarks As Lambert already noted with regard to TU 38, because the gods deserve only the best, the offerings mentioned in the text only consist of the best food and liquids, while cheaper products such as pork, goat meat and fish are missing, as are fruits and vegetables, probably because these were not available throughout the year.37 As one would expect Anu, as the city god of Uruk and most important resident of the Res-temple, receives most of the offerings. See for example the total amount of liquids for Anu (obv. 1-16) which is much more than the liquids for Antu, lstar Nanaja and the other gods ( obv. 17-20). Also, the offerings for Anu are sometimes more accurately described than the offerings for the other gods: see obv. 28-29 which specifies the loaves for the two morning and evening meals for Anu, while for the other gods only the total numbers are mentioned. á Can we determine any differences between the four meals? The different kinds of liquids are the same for the morning and evening meals, except for the milk, which is missing in the main and second meal of the evening (obv. 6-7); the serving of fresh milk only during the morning meals probably reflects general custom.38 Furthermore, while the main and second meal of the morning receive 8 loaves each, the main and second meal of the evening receive seven e~ch (obv. 28-29). As far as the meat offerings ate concerned, from our table it becomes clear that there are many differences between the four meals. First of all, there is a remarkable difference between the meat products for the main and second meal of the morning: the first meal has more sheep, of which only seven in the morning meal are of :first-quality, while the second meal contains ducks, geese, marratu-birds,turtledoves, ostrich eggs and duck eggs. A suckling calf is mentioned only in the main meal, while eight lambs are-mentioned only in the second meal. The main and second meals of the evening are exactly the same, and the total amount of meat offerings is less then in the morning m~ls. Also quality differences exist so far as the meat offerings go: sheep which have been fed with barley are of a higher quality than those not fed with barley; and ducks which 34 See II.1. 
3S Cf. F. Blome, Opfermaterie,59-60, who considers some food taboos for certain deities. W.G. Lambert, 
in: OLA 55 (1993), 199 has given some suggestions for explaining these taboos. 
36 See 1.3. 
37 ib. For fruit see also III. 7. I. 
38 Fresh milk cannot be kept for more than a few morning hours, when it is cool, see M. Stol, in RLA 8 
(1994), 192. 
are fed with dough are of a higher quality than those not fed with dough, but both the ones fed with barley and those not fed with barley are offered for all four meals. We can conclude that the difference between the morning and the evening meals lies apparently more in the quantities than in the qualities of the foodstuffs and liquids. The quantity of offerings is higher in the morning meals then in the evening meals, while perhaps the mentioning of more loaves and first-quality sheep only in the morning meal also suggests that the main meal of the morning is more important than .the second. 39 TU 38 does not state who performed the ritual instructions. Only in the beginning of the text a priest, addressed in the second person, appears (obv. 1, 2, 17). This person could be either the mubannu 'the arranger of the offering table',, 40 or he could be the exorcist (asipu), which is more likely, because the scribe of the text, Samas-etir, is an exorcist. Furthermore, the mubannu is attested only rarely in the temple ritual texts, while the exorcist played a major part in many of the rituals from Uruk and Babylon.41 TU 38 very extensively describes what and how much was used for the meals, and furthermore where, when, and for which deities the foodstuffs were served. It also presents an elaborate list of ceremonies and offerings and in addition a description of the Urukaean cult is given in the colophon. As we saw, Falkenstein already dismissed this colophon as propaganda of the Urukaean priesthood for the Late Babylonian Anu.cult,42 and indeed the scribe's elaborate description of the food products, ceremonies and offerings clearly shows that the text was written for propaganda purposes. Nevertheless this does not disqualify the entire text as unreliable. The scribe Samas-etir may have exaggerated, but he did not invent what was not there. There is no reason to believe that the meals were not served in the Urukaean temples along the line as described in TU 38. Certainly, the foodstuffs used and the quantities referred to in the text may have differed in time and from temple to temple, but having said this, the text gives us a unique insight into the offering practices in Hellenistic Uruk. III.3. The offering site The location where the food and drink offerings in front of the statue of one or more gods were placed, and where the offering table and the offering accoutrements were set up,43 was sometimes called Kl SiSKUR GABA.RI 'the place where (the god) is made 39 Note also the fact that the sheep oflesser quality, which have not been fed with barley, are only called 'fat' 
in the section of the main (rev. 6) and second (rev. 15) meal of the morning, but not in the section concerned 
with the evening meals (rev. 20, 23), which could suggest a dominance of the morning over the evening 
meals. However, since the adjective is also missing in the enumeration of the four meals (rev. 26), it could 
merely reflect the slovenliness of the writer.

111.3.The offering site to accept the offering'.44 It had to be a secluded site,45 away from daily secular life and safe from any intrusion of evil. The temple ritual texts often only mention the temple(name) as the place where offerings took place, but sometimes a certain place in the temple is referred to, like for example the courtyard (kisallu) or the Grand Courtyard (kisalmahbu) in the Res.temple,46 or more specific places like the workshop (bft mummi) in the Res-temple, 47or the roof of the Anu-temple. 48 Sometimes offerings were placed outside the temple, as for example 'in the open country or on the bank of a river, on a place where nobody sets foot'. 49 curtains Sometimes the temple ritual texts refer to curtains (siddu) which are used to isolate the offering place, or to the birft siddi '(the room) between the curtains', 50 which is the passage way between the cella, where the statue resides, and the ante-ceIIa. 51 By using this curtain the offering table and the statue were hidden from human eyes during the ritual of the divine meal. Although this practice may have originally reflected palace protocol, in the temple its main purpose was not to disclose to outsiders that the gods did not really consume the offerings and that after the divine meal was finished it was áthe priests who disposed of the food and drinks, which as substantial 'leftovers' were presented to the priests and other temple personnel. The normal procedure with regard to the curtains was as follows: first offering preparations, purifications and fumigations, after which offerings and libations were performed; then the curtains were drawn shut (siddli sadlidu), 52 after which lamentations were recited. When the recitations have ended the curtains were loosened (siddinubl}u) and the procedure was completed.53 Apparently the gods also spent the night behind closed curtains. This is at least the case for Bel in Esagila during the New Year festival in Babylon.54 44 TU 39, obv. 30. See my comments on this line in the Appendix. See also TU 42 +, obv. 28', 30'.

You will moisten (I. 32') the reed urigallu-standard,the magic circle of flour, 32'(and) a white and black cord (and) throw (it) into the river. You will"purify (I. 33') all the temples (with) takpertu-purifications33'and (especially) Edumununna, the temple of Sin'. Because the urigallu-standard is mentioned here together with the circle, we may assume that both, together with the white and black cord, had the function of creating a secluded offering site. 111.4. The offering preparations Several terms whichare used in connection with the preparations of offerings are attested in the temple ritual texts. The offerings were made on offering tables (passuru, paµru ), which were set up in front of the divine statue(s) in the cella. On the table offenng arrangements (tabn'ftu)were placed. The offering table was set by the 'arranger of the offering table' (mubannu).Finally the texts refer to the offering accoutrements (riksu). In this section we will discuss these terms. III.4.I. passuru andpa{'fru Often in the temple ritual texts the description of the preparation of the ceremony begins with the offering table (passuru),58usually of gold (bura,ru),59 which was brought in and set up ( kunnu)in front of the statue. 60 One temple ritual text refers to seven large offering ss zidubdubbuis attested in the Hellenistic eclipse of the moon ritual BRM 4, 6, rev. 45 (see also 46).

Sometimes, however, we find that the offering table. is not specifically mentioned at the beginning of the ceremony, and the text immediately concentrates on the cultic meal.

We can only ascertain that the passiiru is never mentioned together with the pa(fru in a temple ritual text and therefore they apparently excluded each other. Furthermore the pa{fru was used only in the rituals of the lamentation priest (ka/u),74 while the passiiru is mentioned in the other temple rituals. 75 Finally, while passiiru is always singular in the Hellenistic temple ritual texts, the examples of pa{fru are usually plural. Other tables, such as the maskittu, !mown from the Neo-Assyian period, are not attested in Hellenistic rituals. The gub¤u, an altar made ofreed, known from the Old Babylonian period on and mentioned only rarely in the Neo-Assyrian rituals, was replaced by the pa(fru after the Middle Babylonian period. 76 III.4.2. tabnftu Attested only once in the Hellenistic corpus is tabnftu 'table-arrangement'.

From this passage it becomes clear that the mubannunot only prepared the bowls and dishes for the divine meal, but was also allowed to enter the temple. 80 This is confirmed by another pass~ge describing a ceremony, which took place on the :first day ofNisannu during the New Year festival in Babylons!: here the mubannuperforms a ceremony involving a key in the courtyard of Bel in Esagila.

pnvate documents from Hellenistic Uruk which are concerned with a 1¥D1M-utu-prebend. However, Doty's 
reading is followed neither by the dictionaries (cf. A}{w, 404a; CAD, IIJ,298a and id., M/II, 158), nor by

Furthermore, riksu also included the offerings themselves, as Blome has already suggested.89 riksu is cognate with the verb rakiisu (also written KESDA), which has as a basic meaning 'to bind'. The expression riksa rakiisu 'to arrange the offering accoutrements', used at the beginning of the offering ceremony, is well-known from pre-Hellenistic and Hellenistic temple ritual texts.90 When the ceremony had ended, the offering accoutrements were removed, expressed by riksa pafiiru 'to clear away the offering accoutrements' .91 Riksu is also found in connection with the verb ullulu (D-stem of elelu) 'to purify' in the kettled.rwn ritual,92 and with saliimu 'to complete', said of riksu sa passuri 'the offering accoutrements of the offering table', in the New Year festival in Babylon.93 It is interesting that riksu is only attested in Uruk in the rituals of the lamentation priest, i.e. the kettled.rwn ritual and building ritual (TU 44 and TU 45 with parallels). as Cf. AHw, 984b, B, 2, a ('Opferzuriistung¥). Translated as 'a set table of offerings' by-CAD, E, 244b sub b. See also the definition of riksu in St. M. Maul, Zukunftsbewiiltigung,66, n.74. A rare Neo-Babylonian 
example exists in the ritual T.G. Pinches, Berens collection, no. 110, rev. 15. 
86 In a liturgical calendar text from Hellenistic Uruk, TU 48 (see 11.2.2); the text refers to a taqribtuá 
lamentation incipit which has to be recited on day 1 ofNisannu, over the offering accoutrements (rak-su)to 
Anu (obv. 8-9). Perhaps also in Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 1 (+ //), 10, 25. 
87 Both pa!siiru and pa(iru, since riksu is found not only in the rituals of the lamentation priest but also 
in other rituals. However, in the Neo-Assyrian ritual IV R2, 23, no. l +, III, 25 the pa(iru is set up and the 
offering accoutrement is arranged (GI.DU 8 GIN-an KESDA [KESDA]), which suggests that perhaps in this 
case the pa(iru is not part of the riksu.

Riksu in connection with epesu (cf. CAD, E, 217a) is not attested in the Hellenistic temple ritual texts. 
For every god who participates in the ritual (in the kettledrwn ritual also for the drwn 
itself) an offering accoutrement is arranged. Part of the offering accoutrements is the 
offering table, which in these texts is only the paffru, since we already noticed that the 
passuruis not attested in the rituals of the lamentation priest. However, in general there is probably no restriction of paffru to riksu in Hellenistic ritual texts, because in the only example from Babylon (mentioned above) riksu is indeed connected with the passuru. 111.S. Fumigation Fumigation94 is a religious act, during which barley, aromatics, flour, incense and aromatic woods are scattered (sariiqu) on a censer; the burning of these materials results in smoke which, because of its pleasant smell, pleases the gods, just as did presenting of the food as offerings.95 Therefore, fumigation is a form of offering, which is confirmed by the fact that serqu andsurqinnu, cognates of the verb sarliqu, mean 'offering' ( CAD) or 'Schiittopfer' (AHw) and areá also used for food offerings.96 Furthermore, although fumigation is not a secular table custom to dispel the odor of food,97it has a purifying function: the burning of aromatics and incense purifies the atmosphere.98 In the divine meal fumigation could be performed either before or afterthe foodstuffs and liquids were served. The instrument used for fumigation is the censer. While the use of the sebtu-censer and the qutrfnu-censer is restricted to earlier periods, 99 the nignakku.censer (NiG.NA) is attested up to the Hellenistic period.100 It was made of gold IOI or silver102 and used in all known temple rituals.103 Together with the torch (gizillu) and holy water-basin ( egubbu) it was also used for consecrations and purifications.104 In this section we will first examine how fumigation wasdescribedin the temple ritual texts. Then we will discuss the different fumigation materials which are attested. 94 Cf. G. Furlani, Sacrificio,353; F. Blome, Opfermaterie,272-84.

The divine meal III.5.1. sariiqu and sakiinu In Akkadian the most likely candidates for 'fumigation' are as mentioned surqinnu and serqu, 105but in the Hellenistic temple ritual texts surqinnu is not attested at all, and for serqu we only have a few examples.106 However, the cognate verb sariiqu 'to scatter' is used many times in the context of offerings of meat and libations. We find that cedar needles, ma~f,atu-flour, aromatics and juniper are scattered upon the censer, which indicates fumigation. Also, the phrase nignak(ki) buriisi sakiinu, 'to place a censer (with) juniper' i.e. 'which burns juniper', is used. 107 Are there other references to fumigation without the verb sariiqu and sakiinu? We have several examples from Uruk of the expression nignakka (/.}urii~u) mullu 'to fill (malu D-stem) the (golden) censer' .10s On one occasion the Uruk mfs pf-ritual text states that the (in this case unfired) censer is filled with asiigu-coals and scattered with boxtree. 109 In this text the verb ~enu is also used: to heap asiigu-coals, probably on the censer. 110 The expressions are always made in direct connection with meals and/or offerings of oxen and sheep. The verb qatiiru, in D-stem qutturu 'to cause something to smoke, to make an incense offering, to cense, fumigate, to fume incense' (CAD) appears to be missing from Hellenistic temple ritual texts. 11I Finally, we add that the burning (qalu) of aromatics during burnt offerings of meat and other foodstuffs is not to be interpreted as fumigation.I 12 III.5.2. Fumigation materials We already encountered most of the materials which were used for fumigation: we mentioned cedar needles (luksu?), boxtree (simessalu), ma~f,atu-flour, aromatics (riqqu) and juniper (buriisu). Strangely enough we find that qutrfnu 'incense', 113 nor qutiiru 'fumigant', is attested 10s For serqu see B.A. Levine, W.W.

We may presume however that aromatics in general (riqqu), at least in the Hellenistic period, also included incense. 115 That the garden was the origin of these aromatics is well-known. 116 An indication whence the aromatics, used in the cult of Hellenistic Babylon, came, is given by an administrative text, BRM 1, 99, rev. 26--27 (// CT 49, 150, obv. 23-24): gisKJRI6 simLJ la-me-e E {E} dGu-la E.6UR.SAG .SIKIL.LA 'the garden of juniper surrounding the temple of Gula, Ebursagsikilla' .117 . As a source for the aromatics used in Hellenistic Uruk we have the garden of Ebilianna, the shrine ofNanaja, probably in the Eanna-complex,II 8 in VS 15, 13 (146 S.E.), obv. 3 and 6: gisKIRI6 E.]jl.IL.AN.NA 'the garden ofEbil(i)anna'.1 19 111.6. Consecration, purification and washing In order to perform the divine meal succesfully the offering site, and also everything which, and everyone who, participated in the meal had to be 'pure'. This was partly achieved by fumigation, which purifies the atmosphere, 120 but equally by performing consecrations, purifications, sweeping the ground and sprinkling with water, everything else was made pure. Furthermore, the priest who performed the ritual purified himself by washing. á According to the Hellenistic temple ritual texts these religious activities could take place at different moments during the divine meal.121 In this section these activities will be discussed. III.6.1. Consecration The Hellenistic temple ritual texts on occasion refer to a ritual act called !Jub bfti 'the consecration of the temple'. It is well attested for the public cult in texts from the Neo-Assyrian 122 and Hellenistic periods. 114 Other than Bagh. Mitt.

In Hellenistic Babylon during the New Year festival, on the fifth day of the month Nisannu, first the temple complex Esagila was consecrated (habu), 123 and then Ezida, the cella ofNabu, was consecrated, in the last case by using the censer (nignakku), the torch (gizillu) and the holy water-basin (egubbu).124 In Hellenistic Uruk the RM-temple was consecrated during the second New Year festival on the seventh day of Tasritu.125 During the Uruk building ritual the temple was consecrated with takpertu-purifications, I26 which illustrates the close connection ~tween consecration and purification. Objects could also be consecrated. In the beginning of the Uruk text describing what occured during a night vigil, the Scepter, which plays an important part in the ritual, is consecrated by the exorcist (asipu).121In the Uruk kettledrum ritual a censer and torch are used to consecrate the bull128 and the kettledrum.129 III.6.2. Purification The importance of purifications is underlined by the fact that they are mentioned in the colophon of TU 38, detailing the daily offering practice in Uruk. Rev.44-45 mention 'the pure sulubbu-purification rites' (SU.LUij.ijA KU.MES) and 'the .divine su/ubhu.purification rites of the Res-temple, the Esgal-temple, the Eanna-temple and the ( other) temples of Tiranna' (SU.LUij.ljA DINGIR.RA sa Ere-es ES.GALE.AN.NA uE.MES TIR.AN.NAki).130 takpertu and kuppuru We already referred to the takpertu-purifications in connection with the verb biibu. However, takpertu is also used with the cognate verb kuppuru (D-stem of kapiiru) 'to purify'. The earliest references go back to the Old Babylonian period, but the purification is best attested in the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods. 131 In the Late Babylonian Uruk eclipse of the moon text the priest must purify all the temples, and especially Edumununna, the temple of the moongod Sin, with takpertu-purification~. The next day these purifications, together with a magic circle of flour (zisurru) and a garakku-brazier, are thrown into the river. I32 123 RAcc., 140, 340ff.

rites for Anu and I!itar on a unknown day of the 6th month Uliilu are also attested in the Uruk cultic calendar text K 3753, obv. I, 15. A Graeco-Babyloniaca fragment from Babylon, VAT 412 (M.J.Geller,ZA 87 (1997), 78-9, no. 13), palaeographically dated to the time ofTiberius(!), reads perhaps in obv. 5': ¥par-:#'gu_'LUl::l'..ijA[ .MES]. However, because according to Geller VAT 412 is probably a school text (containing extracts copied from other sources) we cannot use this passage as evidence for Babylonian cult practices in the first century A.D. 131 See the dictionaries CADandAHw sub takpelirtuand kapiiru. 132 BRM4, 6, rev. 32-33 and 37. Note that takpertu-purifications together with burnt offerings are also attested For the use of kuppuru without the noun takpertu we have two examples in the Hellenistic temple ritual texts. Firstly, in a Uruk building ritual text it is said that an exorcist and a lamentation priest will purify the city.133 Secondly, in the Esagila ritual text describing the New Year festival of the month Nisannu in Babylon, after the consecration ofEzida, the cella ofNabu (see III.6.1 ), an exorcist purifies the cella by using the carcass of a sheep, after which it is thrown into the river,134 teliltu and elelu For the purification called teliltu we have many references from the Middle and Neo.Assyrian, but only a few from the Neo-Babylonian period,135 For the Hellenistic period only two examples, both from cultic calendar texts, are Imown, but the context in both cases is not clear.136 However. the cognate verb elelu (in D-and Dt-stem) is attested several times in the Hellenistic corpus in connection with the temple. In the Uruk kettledrum ritual the bull, the hide of which is used to cover the kettledrum, and the kettledrum itself are purified.137 In the Uruk building ritual the king purifies himself. 138 sabii.tu and qadiisu The ground had to be sweeped (sabiitu)in order to clear the offering site. This is attested in the Uruk kettledrum ritual (tasabbit,written SAR, 'you will sweep')i39 and is a form of purification, as is illustrated by the duplicate, which reads instead: tu-rq(uI'-da-as'you will make ritually clean' (qadiisuD-stem).140 The ground is also sweeped in the Uruk mis-pf-ritua1,141 and in the Uruk building ritual the roof of the temple is sweeped.142 This activity is also attested in a late Neo-Babylonian Uruk ritual for the king. 143 saliil}u and sariiqu After the ground was sweeped, it was sprinkled with water, in order to make the dust settle; this makes sprinkling a part of the purification activities. in Neo-Assyrian letters dealing with the substitute king (sar pub,) ritual, which are probably performed to

The verb saliibu (SU) 'to sprinkle' is used in connection with several locations: the Esagila-temple and Ezida, the cella ofNabu, were sprinkled with water from a well along the Tigris and a well along the Euphrates during the New Year festivities in Babylon. 144 Pure water was sprinkled on the roof of a temple in the building ritual in Uruk,145 and in the same ritual in the open country or on the bank of a river. 146 Pure water was also sprinkled during the kettledrum ritual on the ground in the workshop ( bft mummi), where the bull, whose hide was used to cover the kettledrum, is placed.147Also note that water from the holy water-basin was sprinkled on the bull.148 Furthermore in the Uruk kettledrum ritual cedar balsam (dam ereni) was sprinkled for purification purposes on the bull itself,149 and on the (still uncovered) kettledrum. 150 And finally, an unknown substance was used to sprinkle the temple during the last phase of the Uruk eclipse of the moon ritual.ISi Also scattering (sarliqu) juniper on the heart of the bull during the Uruk kettledrum ritual must have had purification purposes.152 On two occasions sarliqu is used without object: during the Uruk New Year festival and during a special festival for !star ofUruk aromatics presumably were scattered 'on the place where (the god) is made to accept the offering', after which offerings follow.153 If we assume correctly that aromatics are the object, then these two passages may be connected with purification. Furthermore, good oil was sprinkled on the torch used during the night vigil festivities, 154all kinds of aromatics (riqqil kalama) and powder(?) of cedar (qem erem) were scattered during the Uruk mfspf-ritual.1 55 egubbu In the descriptions of the divine meal we often encounter the holy water-basin (egubbu, dugA.GUB.BA).

III.6. Consecration, purification and washing The holy water-basin-ceremony is well attested in temple ritual texts from the Hellenistic period. It is one of the ceremonies, mentioned in the Uruk text TU 38,157 from which it becomes clear that loaves and cakes and oxen and sheep apparently were used during the ceremony. We also know of an incantation incipit 'From the pure holy water-basin', recited during the New Year festival of the month Tasritu in Uruk.158 As we saw above, during the New Year festivities of Nisannu in Babylon it was used together with the censer and the torch to consecrate Ezida, the cella of Nabfr in Esagila.159 Furthermore, in the Uruk text which describes the night vigil festivities, the exorcist must extinguish the torch with water from the holy water-basin (together with beer, milk, wine and oil).160 In the Uruk eclipse of the moon ritual first all the temples are purified, then the statue of Sin is robed, after which a holy water-basin is set up and incantations are recited.161 . Finally, the holy wat~r-basin was used on a number of occasions during the Uruk kettledrwn ritual: after two holy water-basins for the gods Kusu and Ningirim have been set up, offering tables are placed and food is served. 162 With water from the holy water.basin of Ningirim the offering accoutrements are purified,163 and the bull is sprinkled with water from the holy water-basin.164After the bull is slaughtered the kettledrwn itself, after being consecrated by using the censer and torch, is purified with water from the holy water-basin. !65 111.6.3. Washing In the Hellenistic temple ritual texts several kinds of washing activities are attested. Although we only have a few examples of washing expressed by the verbs ramiikuor mesu, there are many references to hand-washing (me qliti). This hand-washing was intended to cleanse the body of the priest who performs the ritual. It made the priest 'pure' and allowed him to proceed with the rest of the ritual, which sometimes contained another washing activity, the 'washing of the mouth' (m'fspf). This ritual had to be performed on the divine protagonist of the ritual, which could be either the statue of the god, an animal like the bull, or even an object like the torch. We will discuss these washing activities here. 157 Obv. 37; rev.37; see II.I. 158 BRM 4, 7, obv. 13.

The context is less clear in W 18728 (A. Falkenstein, UVB 15 [1959), 40--44), rev. 16'. The holy water basin is also attested in the astronomical diaries from Babylon: No. -173, A, rev. 2-3, mentioned together with offerings; No. -200, A, rev. 16, in the cella of Bel in Esagila. III The divine meal Washing with river water From the large temple ritual text describing days 2-5 of the New Year festival of the month Nisannu in Babylon, we know that at the beginning of every day the high priest (a!Ju rabu) began by washing himself (ramiiku, written TUs) with river water, on one occassion specified as coming from the Tigris and Euphrates, after which he removes the curtain for the god Bel and recites a prayer.166 Hand-washing meqiiti nasu In Akkadian 'hand-washing' can be expressed in different ways. Firstly, there are references to meqiiti nasu (written A.MES SU11 iL) 'to lift up the water (basin) for (the washing of) the hands' .167 It is attested in the Uruk New Year festivals ofTa¤ritu 168 and Nisannu,169 in the Uruk ritual text describing a special festival for Istar,110 and in the Uruk text describing the night vigil. 171 It is also attested in the Kislimu ritual of Esagila in Babylon. 172 On one occassion the basins used are identified as 2 kallu-bowls and a golden suq7u-vessel.17J They were probably placed on offering tables.t 74 These references state that the priest must 'lift up the water (basin) for (the washing of) the hands' for one or more deities after which, we assume, the priest proceeded by washing his hands; although this is never stated as such, it seems likely since often no further use of the water is indicated. We also assume that me qiiti is intended in the first place for the priest, as is specifically stated in one case. 175 However, the texts sometimes continue by indicating that the priest then 'sprinkles the king and the other persons' ,176 It is not impossible that me qiiti is also used for this, because there is a connection between me qiiti and the king: during the New Year festival of Nisannu in Babylon a water (basin) for (the washing of) the hands is moved in front of the king, 1"'7which may suggest that hand-washing was also performed by the king. Supporting evidence comes from a speech later on in the ritual, during which the high priest advises the king: ~At the opening of the gate ceremony, cleanse [your] hands [ ... ] !11s'. 166 RAcc., 129, 2; 132, 158; 133, 218; 136,286 (in the later case: from the Tigris and Euphrates). 167 Cf. CAD,M/11, 155b, sub 3; AHw, 664b, 4, a. In the Assyrian rituals the expression me qati ana DN (ana LUGAL)qurrubu(instead of na!u) is more common, e.g. in the rituals for the singer (zammaru), BBR 2, nos. 60-70. 16s TU 39, obv. 22, 29, 33; TU 40, obv. 3, 6, 20, rev. 3, 4; TU 39, rev. 12, 16. 169 KAR 132, I, 24, 111,17, JY,11. 110 TU 42 +, obv. 28', 32', rev. 26'. 111 TU 41, obv. 18, 24, 32.

We have instead in these texts many references to 'setting up the water (basin)' (mekunnu) before drawing the curtains shut, and 'lifting up (i.e. removing) the water (basin)' (me nasu) after the curtains are loosened again. 179 Although the function of this water basin is never specifically indicated, we know that it was for hand-washing.

While pit pi is not attested in the Hellenistic temple ritual texts, we have some evidence for mis pf,183 Four texts from Uruk are known; 184 they probably fall into the 179 Kettledrum ritual: TU 44, II, 7 // Bagh.

Hellenistic period, 1ss and describe the end of the mispi-ritual. Although the ritual appears to be in many ways unchanged in comparison with the earlier Assur version of the ritual, there are also some new elements, 186 in particular the appearance of the brushwood pile (abru), which is set on fire,187the references to lamentations, which have to be recited by the lamentation priest,188 and the appearance of the king with or without the people.189 The mispf-ritual could also be performed on objects other than the statue of a god.190 In the Uruk text TU 41, describing the festivities performed during a night vigil, the m'fs pf-ritual was performed on a large torch, which was one of the protagonists in the night vigil festivities; 191 the interpretation of the ritual in this case is difficult. Furthermore, in the Uruk kettledrum ritual the m'fspf-ritual could be performed on a bull, the hide of which was used the cover the kettledrum,192 and on the kettledrum itself.193 The Neo-Assyrian catalogue of recitations which had to be performed during the kettldrum ritual, IV R2, 23, no.

Offerings and libations An important phase in the divine meal was the presentation of foodstuffs and liquids as offerings. In this section we shall first analyse how and what was served to the deities in the temples. Then we shall examine which offerings and libations are attested, concentrating on the terminology used in the Hellenistic temple ritual texts.

The presentation of the offerings Serving foodstuffs and liquids as offering There are several verbs which are used to describe the presentation of the offerings before the god in the temple_l95 Saraqu 'to scatter' is used in the descriptions of the Uruk kettledrum ritual, in connection with dates and sasqu-flour,196 loaves of barley and emmer bread and a mirsu-confection (made with honey, ghee, dates and sasqu-flour),197 and barley seed.198 It is also used in the Uruk building ritual texts, in connection with emmer bread, dates a.,d sasqu-flour;199 and all (kinds of) barley seed (zerukalama).200And it is attested in the Uruk mispf-ritual, in connection with barley seed.201 Sakanu 'to place' in general is used with the same food products. In the kettledrum ritual it is used with barley bread and emmer bread and a mirsu-confection (made with honey, ghee, dates and sasqu-flour),202 and furthermore with barley and emmer malt,203 and with beer.204 In the building ritual and the m'fspf-ritual it is used with the mirsu-confection made with honey, ghee, dates, sasqu-flourand pressed oil.205 and the zzbu-offering. Si/tu is some kind of food which can be presented as an offering (CAD, S, 267, AHw, 
1044a). It is attested only once in the Hellenistic ritual text corpus, in TU 39, obv. 13, together with the 
guqqu-offering. Perhaps siltu is cognate with the Hebrew/Aramaic noun n~b twheat groats I, 
195 In the Hellenistic prebend texts from Uruk we often find the verb elu (E11) lto come up, to go upl in the 
S-stem 1to liring up1, in the context of bringing food up to the table (pas!iiru)in front of the divine statue(s).

Blome suggested ( Opfermaterie,274= 76) that zira sarllqu (SE.NUMUN DUB) and zero kalama sariiqu (SE.NUMUN DU.A.Bl DUB) are general phrases: the object SE.NUMUN stands for Eoffering material for fumigation' and the verb DUB for 1burning on a censer!. However, barley seed belongs to the food products and not to the aromatics, which explaines why it is never mentioned in connection with the censer. Furthermore, we always find the expression in the context of offerings of meat and libations. Also, almost always before the scattering of barley seed, the phrase nignak(ki) buriisi .fakiinu is used (see III.5.1), which indicates that only the latter phrase refers to fumigation. 201 Bagh.

also presented 'with a solemn ritual gesture, passing it in a swinging motion before the staring eyes of the image', comparing this with offering practices described in Egyptian religious texts and the Old Testament.226 But what exactly was he referring to? In the Mesopotamian ritual texts, we do know of several passages with sutuqu(S-stem of etequ) 'to pass (objects) on, to move (objects) past (a person or another object)' _221 Several occurrences of u-se-ti-iq withana pa-ni in Hellenistic ritual texts are attested.228 However, on closer examination these cannot be the phrases which Oppenheim refers to. They all describe the passing on of offering dishes etc., which are in front of, or passed (from) before (piim) one god, to (ana plim) other gods, as for example in TU 39, obv. 25: ' 25He will pass the golden dish ( from) before (pa-m) Anu to ( ana pa-m) the ( other) gods, who are in the Grand Courtyard'. In texts from the Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods sutuqu corresponds to the Baby.lonian verb subu'u (ba'u S-stem) 'to move (an object) alongside (a person for ritual purposes)',229 but the relevant examples of subu'uin the Hellenistic temple ritual texts do not describe moving offerings in a swinging motion in front of a statue, but the moving of a censer and torch inside the temple,230 or the moving of a water (basin) for (washing of) the hands in front of the king, and do not therefore parallels OT and Egyptian practices either.231 Fruit Sometimes fruit (inbu) was used during the divine meal, 'adding anesthetic touch~.232 See for example the Uruk temple ritual text TU 41, describing the night vigil festivities: after a golden offering table is set up for Anu and Antu of Heaven, and a water basin is brought for the washing of the hands, the table is arranged with meat, beer and wine. Then the text reads ( obv. 20): 'You will provide all (kinds of) garden fruits (inib kiri) in abundance (tu-sar-ra-a!J)': The text follows with the scattering of cedar needles(?) and ma~batu-flouron a golden censer. The ritual ends with a libation of wine. Then follows a similar ritual conducted on seven large golden offering tables for the seven planets (Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Mars, Moon and Sun), after which fruit from the garden plants is again used I 226 A.L. Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia, 192. In the OTwe find that not only placing an offeringin front of a god, but also waving (i1Eml'l)and lifting up (ill'J111'1)in front of God or the altar was practised. ' ' 227 CAD,'E,391a, C. 228 TU 39, obv. 25; KAR 132,I, 2; 3; 4; TU 42 +, obv. 22'; 23'. 229 Cf. CAD,B, 181b sub 3, a; AHw, 117a,S,3. 230 RAcc., 140, 343. 231 RAcc., 144,413. 232 A.L. Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia, 188. ( obv. 26). A similar phrase is used in TU 12, an astrological text from Hellenistic Uruk, which is concerned with the zodiacal system.233 To slaughter an animal for offerings To offer an animal for meat offerings means first having to slaughter it. Akkadian has several words for 'slaughtering' sacrificial animals, of which nakiisu,234 mabii~u,235 and paliiqu 236 are attested in the Hellenistic temple rituals. 237They are, however, unlike in ancient Israel, 238'entirely secular in overtones since there was no Kosher slaughtering in ancient Babylonia, and no custom of burning slaughtered victims to ashes' .239 III.7 .2. Food and drink offerings niqu-offerings The Akkadian word most often used for 'offering' is niqu,240 written syllabically and SISKUR or SISKUR. Often it is preceded by UDU.NiTA, indicating that it usually consisted of sheep, although oxen and goats were also used. It is cognate with the verb naqu (BAL) 'to pour out (as a libation), to offer'. It is well-known from the Neo-Assyrian temple rituals, and Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid administrative texts.241 In the Hellenistic temple ritual texts both sheep and cattle are attested as niqu-offering. We have a few examples of the phrases niqii naqu 'to make an offering' (SISKUR BAL) and niq a/pi u immeri naqu 'to make an offering of ox and sheep' (SISKUR GU4 uUDU.NiTA BAL). They are all from Uruk and are attested in texts describing the New Year of the month Tasritu, the special festival for !star, and the night vigil.242 For the phrase niqe naqu 'to make a sheep offering' (udu.[nitaJ.SiSKUR BAL) there is more m Obv. lower part, col. VI, last line reads: [GURUN] gitKIRI6 tu-sar-ra-ab'You will provide garden fruit in abundance'. For TU 12 see also II.2.3. For the garden see also Ill.5.2. For fruit symbolizing aphrodisiacs, as George suggests, in a fragment related to the so-called Divine Love Lyrics, see II.8.5. 234 1V 38, rev. 9; 11.

Beih. 1, no. 5, rev. 23; cf. he Nee-Assyrian parallel KAR 60, obv. 15. 237 Not attested in Hellenistic temple ritual texts, although well-known from Assyrian rituals (see the dictionaries CAD and AHw) are nasiil,uand tabiiyu. 238 Although there was both secular and sacred slaughtering, in a sense all slaughtering was religious, since meat with blood was not allowed to be eaten by humans (Gen. 9, 4; Lv. 3, 17; 7, 27; 27, 10). This is because blood (tl"'T).is the soul, the power oflife (Lv. 17, 14; Deut. 12, 23), or is the location of the soul (Lv. 17, 10-.11); when blood is fl.owing out of the body, man or animal will die. Therefore all slaughtering was religious and had to be performed in a kosher manner. This 'blood consciousness', as Oppenheim called it (Ancient Mesopotamia, 192), is not paralleled in Mesopotamia. The concept of 'the life being in the blood' was known, but there was no general prohibition on the consuming of blood, nor of offering it, as, for example, was done by the king in KAR 146, rev. I, 1 O'. 239 W.G. Lambert, in: OLA 55 (1993), 194. 240 Cf. G .J.P. McEwan, FAOS4, 169. 241 See the dictionaries CAD and AHw sub niqu and naqu.

We find that in the diaries just as in the temple ritual texts sheep offerings are used side by side with offerings of cattle; together they are often referred to as nindabu 'food offering' (see below). These offerings are in most cases provided by a high official of Esagila, such as the administrator (satammu) or his representative (kiim satammi), sometimes performed in a specific place in the temple, e.g. the dude-Gate or the 'Gate of the Son of the Prince'. Sometimes the offerings are used for the cult of the king and his family. 249 naqu-/ibations , The verb which is usually used for libations250 is naqu (BAL) 'to pour out'. It is well.known especially from the Assyrian rituals.2s1 In the Hellenistic temple ritual texts from Uruk we find naqu252 with wine, beer, milk, honey, ghee, oil and cedar oil, in several different combinations. It is interesting that, with one exception,253 all examples come from temple rituals for the lamentation 243 TU 44, II, 3; 5; 33; III, 18; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 13; cf.

In a building ritual text it is said that the lamentation priest (kalu) must continue with'serqu.offerings,maqqitu-libations (ma-aq-qa-a-tu) and recitations.259 Furthermore, during the Babylon Esagila ritual, on day 4 ofKislimu, offerings ([m]a-qa-a-tu4)of m~l}atu-flour are scattered on the brazier by the high priest (abu rabu).26o Themaqqu-libationbowl, usually made of gold, belongs to the category of the sappu.containers.261 It is mentioned many times in Hellenistic temple rituals. It is placed on a offering table (passuru)in front of the statue of the god in the temple. 262The expression usually used is maqqe redu 'to make a libation with the libation bowl'.263While (as we saw) the libation expressed by naqu is almost exclusively used in the Uruk rituals for the lamentation priest, we find libations with the maqqu-Iibationbowl in the other Uruk 254 The kettledrum ritual: beer, wine, milk, cedar oil, honey and ghee (TU 44, I, 11, 29-30, 32; II, 4, 7, 35;

265rituals, such as the description of the daily offering practice,264 the New Year festival,_and the. festival for Istar;266 no examples from Babylon are known. The liquids which are usually libated from the maqqu-libation bowl are wine, different types of beer and milk. The expression maqqe naqu 'to pour out with the libation bowl' is mostly kno~ from Assyrian rituals, but it is also attested in the Uruk ritual concerning the night Vtgtl festivities.267 We have evidence from administrative texts belonging to the Rabimesu archive (9~ 93 B.C.) from Babylon that both maqq'ftu and maqqu were used well into the Arsacid period.268 kliribu and tardft sarri The kliribu, perhaps not a priest but a citizen, a praying, private person, who offers 0:'1 special occasions,269 is attested froin the Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian p~n.ods on.270terdftu 'additional offering' is known from the Middle and Neo-Babyloman periods on.271However, for the Hellenistic period they are only known from the Uruk description of the daily offering practice in TU 38. As we already saw, in this text a list of offerings and ceremonies is presented.272 We suggested that the offerings men.tioned here are in fact four general groups of offerings. 273 Among these four groups of offerings, there are two which are named: the offerings of the kliribus and the additional offerings of the king (tardft sarri). We also saw that the food products used for these offerings consisted of cakes, loaves, possibly oil and flour, and finally meat.274 This information supports McEwan's idea that tardft sarri may be identified with 
the niq'f sarri 'the offerings of the king' which are mentioned many times together with 
the niqf kliribi 'the offerings of the kliribu' in documents from the Nee-Assyrian and 
Nee-Babylonian periods.275 The foodstuffs used in these documents, oxen and sheep, 
are also part of the products attested in TU 38 for the offerings of the kliribu and the

additional offerings of the king. Moreover, the presentation of niqi sarri and niqi karibi as a pair belonging together, is very similar to karibu and tardft sarri in TU 38. They represent the participation of a praying (private) person and the king in the Uruk cult activities, which corresponds with our assumption that TU 38 is intended to describe the complete daily offering practice in the temples ofUruk. The tardft sarri-offerings are a part of the sakke sarrutu the 'ritual regulations of kingship' mentioned in the colophon of TU 38.276 merdftu The merdftu-offering is known from Standard and Late Babylonian texts and is often used with its cognate verb redu 'to make a merdftu-offering'. The offering mainly consists of oxen and sheep.277 In the Hellenistic temple ritual texts from Uruk we have a few examples.21s In the Uruk New Year texts of the seventh month Tasritu, on the eighth and ninth day a merditu-offering (written SiSKUR mer-de-e-tu) consisting of ox and sheep is performed (naqu), after which the heart of the ox is scattered with flour and the head of the sheep is libated with wine.279 In the Uruk text describing a special festival for !star, the same procedure is described ( only here with the verb redu) for the eighth and ninth day of Tasritu during the New Year festiva1.2so ginu and sattukku Both ginu and sattukku are regular offerings i.e. they had to be performed every day, contrary to specific offerings, which had to be performed either on specific days of the month (e.g. guqqu, see below), or on a special occasions.281 In the Neo-Babylonian period ginu and sattukku were interchangeable 2S2 and can refer to bread, dates, wine, beer, sheep, fish, oil, sesame, barley, pomegranates and juniper. For the Hellenistic period both are attested in temple ritual texts, building inscriptions, chronicles, and administrative and private documents, although the texts seem to favour ginu. , In the Uruk description of the daily offering practice ginu is ( as expected in this text) dominantly present. As commodities, barley and emmer283 and furthermore oxen and sheep are referred to.284 The ginu used during the Uruk New Year festival of Tasritu consisted of roasted meat, beef and mutton.285 In the Uruk kettledrum ritual barley, 216 Rev. 44.

emmer, salt and juniper are mentioned, perhaps for the ginu, but the context is unclear. 286 In the New Year festival ofNisannu in Babylon no commodities are mentioned for the ginu287and the sattukku,288but again the context is unclear. The building inscription YOS I, 52, from the year 244 B.C. (68 S.E.) is an inscription of Anu-uballit, son of Anu-ik~ur. of the family Abutu, who was given the Greek name Nikarchos. He wasgovernor (saknu) ofUruk during the reign of Seleucus II. The text describes an extensive building undertaking in the Res-temple, the temple of Anu and Antu in Uruk.289The end of the inscription records that the governor made Anu and Antu enter the Res-temple and take their seats in the cella Enamenna, where he established ginu-and sattukku-offeringsas before (gi-nu-u sat-tuk-ku ki-ma ma/}-ri-im-ma u-kinin_ni qe-reb-su)(18-19). No commodities are mentioned. In the last passage of a Hellenistic chronicle regular offerings (ginu) are made in Ekisnugal, the temple of Sin in Babylon. 299 An astronomical diary mentions a general (rab uqu) who g~ve a bull and sheep for the regular offering (ginu) of Bel to the butchers ofEsagila, after which they were offered to Bel.291 In private documents from Uruk ginu is attested only rarely.292 The administrative documents belonging to the Rabimesu archive (94-93 B.C.) from Babylon refer to regular offering sheep, and cereals or meat for the regular offerings. 293 guqqu The guqqu-offering is attested in texts from the Neo-Babylonian, the Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods. It is unknown in Assyria. It was performed on a regular basis on certain days of certain months. 294 When no specific days are mentioned (guqqu sa itiMN), probably the total sum of all the guqqu-offerings of that month (guqqiine)are intended. 295 In the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods the guqqu-offerings consisted mainly of meat (sheep), dates, wine and beer. 286 1V 44, IV, 18.

Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebabbar Temple at Sippar, 145. 29S AUWE 5, 61-2. In the Hellenistic temple ritual texts the guqqu-offerings are mentioned only rarely.296 They are referred to together with clothing ceremonies and siltu-food, which had to be performed on the seventh day of Tasritu during the New Year festival in Uruk. 297 Furthermore, the guqqu-offerings are one of the four groups of offerings listed in TU 38.298Here they precede the essesu-ceremonieswith which they are connected. This connection is confirmed by the Uruk prebend texts where usually the guqqu-offerings are mentioned as a pair with the essesu-ceremonies. As we already suggested, the commodities used for the guqqu-offerings and essesu-ceremonies (loaves, cakes, oxen and sheep) served, together with the commodities of the monthly and yearly unspecified ceremonies, 299 to provide an income for the various prebends of the Hellenistic Uruk temples.JOO 1 nindabu Nindabu 'cereal offering, food offering' is a Sumerian loanword (NIDBA),301 and is attested from the Old Akkadian period on.302 We find the offering usually in cultic context. It is a food offering, originally consisting of bread or cereal. However, McEwan already pointed out303 that nindabu could also contain meat, as becomes clear from Hellenistic chronicle texts.304 Nindabu is, together with niqu, the most frequently mentioned offering in the astronomical diaries from Babylon. 30S In these passages nindabu is used as a general term for food offering, usually consisting of bull and sheep (see my comments on the use of niqu above). From the Hellenistic temple ritual texts we have no examples of nindabu,306with exception of a reference in the eclipse of the moon ritual (BRM 4, 6, obv. 12'-13'). However, it is found in a literary passage, in an Akkadian quotation of a Sumerian lamentation, which had to be sung in front of Sin at the time of an eclipse (see obv. 14). Because in this literary context nindabu is clearly distinguished from niqu as a different type of offering, in this passage the opposition of cereal offerings and meat offerings seems justifiable. 296 G.J.P.

Beih. 2, no. 1 and parallels) and the eclipse of the moon ritual (BRM 4, 6), all from Uruk, refer on many occassions to a brushwood pile (abru), sometimes using a torch (gizillu).For 'setting fire', t~e verbs qiidu,313napabu,314nummuru(D-stem of namliru),315and su:jbutu(S-stem of :jablitu)316are used.

which is supported by similar passages e.g. in the mispi-ritual text K 224 (= E. Ebeling, TuL,27), obv. 20:

out a mibru-offering(?) on the head of the lion(?)'. If Mayer is correct in assuming that flour is poured out 
here (OrNS 47 [1978], 452), then my reading mi-ib-r ri'!'1 is not impossible, since flour is used with mibru in 
Neo-Babylonian texts (thus CAD, Mill, 59b sub 5). Furthermore, Mayer's suggestion 'head of the lion1 is 
supported by an example from the Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions, where a mubburu-offering is made over 
lions killed in a hunt (CAD, M/11, 176a sub 1, a).

Note that bwnt offerings are also attested in Neo-Assyrian letters dealing with the substitute king (sarpiibi) 
ritual, which as we saw were also probably performed to avert evil portended by an eclipse on the king (see 
II.7), e.g. S. Parpola,LAS I, 167. Iv. CONCLUSION We set out in this study to examine whether the temple ritual texts; which were copied during the Hellenistic period from older original compositions, are a reliable source of information on the cult practices of Hellenistic Uruk. and Babylon. Having surveyed the textual evidence discussed in the previous chapters we can now conclude that there is enough evidence to suggest that the temple ritual texts do indeed describe the cultic activities as they took. place during the Hellenistic period. The extensive descriptions of festivals, rituals and offerings in the temple ritual texts show how important the public cults were in Hellenistic times, at least until the first century B.C. Daily ceremonies such as the 'awakening of the temple'-ceremony (dik biti) and the 'opening of the gate' -ceremony (pit babi) are well attested in ritual texts and cultic calendars. Many monthly ceremonies are also known, such as a ceremony called essesu, the monthly clothing ceremony (lubustu), a nocturnal ceremony (bajjatu), an evening ceremony (nubattu), and a ceremony called 'the good-functioning of the temple' -ceremony (salam biti). The same is true for many of the annually celebrated ceremonies, such as the clothing ceremonies, the processions, the divine marriage cer.emonies (basadu), and the brazier festivals (kinunu). Also, for the New Year festivals (akftu) ofUruk. and Babylon there is substantial evidence to be gleaned from Hellenis.tic temple ritual texts. Many of the important temple rituals, such as the kettledrum ritual, the building ritual, the Uruk. lunar eclipse ritual, festivals for !star of Uruk and !star of Babylon, and a nocturnal festival in the Res-temple in Uruk are exten.sively described; other less well-known temple rituals are also attested. They clearly show how active the Babylonians were on matters of religion and cult during the Hel.lenistic period. The large corpus of cult songs (particularly from Babylon) underlines this. Admittedly, these literary texts are copies of older compositions, but the information of other, contemporary sources ( chronicles, astronomical diaries, legal and administra.tive texts, building inscriptions) shows that the cults were still very important in the Hellenistic period. Moreover, some of the rituals (the kettledrum ritual, the building ritual) are referred to in the astronomical diaries. Although because of their damaged state the astronomical diaries are often very enigmatic, as far as the political and reli.gious events described are concerned, they are nonetheless important evidence for the fact that Babylonian religion and cult were not yet dead; the numerous references to temples, gods and religious and cultic activities are firm evidence for the existence of the traditional Babylonian cults in the Hellenistic period. References to the New Year festival occur in all contemporary sources. The same is true for many offerings and libations, presented during the divine meal (naptanu). The practice of using the names of deities in personal names is another important indication of the importance of Babylonian religion and cults in the Hellenistic period. The contemporary sources also refer on many occasions to different temples, not only the Res-temple in Uruk and the Esagila-temple in Babylon, but also to many other temples ( e.g. Esabad, the temple of Gula in Babylon, Eturkalamma, the temple of Istar 167 
IV. Conclusion of Babylon, and the temples of Zababa and Ninlil, of Nabii sa b.are, of Madanu, and the a/atu-temples). We also found that building inscriptions refer to the restorations of temples. Finally, administrative documents show how important the temples were as economic institutions; the prebendary system in Uruk cannot be explained if the cults were not functioning; it shows that the temple was not only an important religious center, but also an important economic institution. The Babylonian cults practised in the temples of Uruk and Babylon in the Hellenistic period are, as far as we can see in the sources, not different from those in the pre.Hellenistic times. All the evidence clearly shows that the Babylonians held on to their old Babylonian traditions. The pantheon referred to in both religious and secular texts is entirely Babylonian. The terminology used for the cul tic activities or the cult participants is not different from pre-Hellenistic times. Even the Macedonian rulership took part in the Babylonian cults; they did not attempt to change the cults but themselves adapted to Babylonian customs. We found only one possible exception to this rule. In particular the astronomical diaries from Babylon contain some references to what may be a local ruler cult for the king and his family, a custom well-known to the Seleucid monarchies. In Babylon such a local ruler cult may have been in practice from the time of Seleucus III on. Also for Uruk we cannot exclude the possibility that certain texts contain references to a ruler cult practice, in which Seleucid kings were honored as superhumans; legal documents concerning prebend shares, dated to the second century B.C., which refer to offerings brought up 'to (the table of) the statues of the kings', may refer to this cult. Although the evidence remains scarce and dubious, this interpretation of the discussed text passages is possible. Hopefully new texts will help us to solve this difficult issue once and for all. APPENDIX

A description of the daily offerings in the temples ofUruk TU 38 (AO 6451)2 
This text describes the ritual instructions for the daily offerings in the temple of Anu (Res) and the other temples in Hellenistic Uruk. On the basis of prosopographic evidence we can date the text to the first half of the second century B.C.: the text is written by Samas-á etir, son oflna-qibit-Anu, son of Sibqat-Anu, who belongs to the family Ekur-zakir. He is also the scribe of the ritual text TU 39-40 (see TU 39, rev. 28-29). Furthermore he ( is known as the owner of several astronomical texts, two of which are dated 118 S.E. (19413 B.C.)3 Samas-eµr is also attested as the scribe of VS15, 32 //HSM 913.2.181 (R. \ 1 Wallenfels, Seleucid Archival Texts, no. VI), dated 119 S.E. (19312 B.C.), and probably also of the much later BRM 2, 54 II BiMes 24, 28, dated 150 S.E. (16211 B.C.) He is also mentioned as the father of the scribe Ina-qibit-Anu in BRM 2, 49 and 50, both dated in the year 166 S.E. (14615B.C.), and probably also in BiMes 24, 12, dated 162 S.E. (150149 B.C.) This indicates that Samas-etir was probably at the end of his career around 155 S.E. (15716 B.C.) According to the colophon the high priest Kidin-Anu of the family Ekur-zakir made a copy of the original tablets, which Nabopolassar had carried off from Uruk to Elam, and brought them back to Uruk during the co-regency of either Seleucus I and Antiochus, which would have been during the period of 20--31 S.E. (292/1-281/0 B.C.), or during the co-regency of Antiochus I and his son Seleucus, 32-45 S.E. (280/79-26716 B.C.). This Kidin-Anu is also known as the father of Anu-ab,a-usabsi, the owner of the tablet BRM4, 7.4 The text is discussed in lll.2. Obv. 1 U4-mi-samkal MU.AN.NAina nap-tan GAL-u sa se-e-ri e-lat sap-pi.MES sa ma-aq-qa.ne-e 2 18sap-pi.MES GUSKIN ina gi¤BANSURdLXta-rak-kas ina lib-bi 7 sap-pi ana XV 3 3 KAS SE.BAR4 KAS lab-ku7 sap-pi a-na 2,303 KAS SE.BAR 1-enKAS lab-ku 4 I-en KAS na-a-su I-en KAS zar-ba-ba it.

RAcc., 75; CAD, L, 34a) is preferable to ribku (cf. AHw, 980b: 'ein (Drogen-)Absud'): see SpTU 3; no. 100, 5, where labiiku is found in the context of brewing beer (reference of M.

It is also attested in KAR 132, I, 23 (written ES.GAL.LA DRU.GAL), and BRM 4, 6, obv. 22; 26; rev. 39. It is also known from private contracts from Hellenistic Uruk: L. Speleers, Recueil, 296, obv. 3 ([E] ES.GAL) and VS 15, 19, rev. 20. In other contracts it also refers to a city quarter of Uruk, see A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 36-39; add: VS 15, 27, obv. 3; G. Kh. Sarkisjan, FuB 16 (1975), 38, no. 25, obv. 3; 4. The reading of this temple name has been much discussed. The reading ES.GAL is accepted widely (cf. MSL IV; 12f., the dictionaries CAD, E, 364, 3, a, andAHw, 257a, 2, and recently A.R. George, House Most High, no. 270), contra IRI10--11,GAL (cf. A.Falkenstein, Topographie, 31-34 and J.J.A. van Dijk, AJO 20 (1963), 162f.). 1. 2, Res, it is not clear whether E = bftu has to be interpreted as the determinative e(Res) or whether we should read Bit-Res; cf. J. Oelsner, Materialien, 330, n. 200 with literature. See also A.R. George, House Most High, no. 940. 1.2 (see also 14, 34), the BARA.MAIJ 'Grand Dais', appellative of the sanctuary, named E.SAR.RA 'House of the Universe', was the temple on top of the Anu-temple tower, cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 27 ff.; A.R. George, House Most High, no. 1036. Cf. also BRM 4, 6, obv. 22; 26; rev. 40. I. 5 (see also 8, 19, 22, 25), UDU ka-lu-u 'sheep (pastured on) k-a/u-land', according to CAD, K, 105a, 2; ib., 1-J, 131b, b'; or: udukalu-offering sheep, cf. AHw, 1402a. See also TU 39, obv. 8. I will follow the CAD. Note that attested in the same position in some Sippartexts ispargallu (AHw, 1582a), see F.Joannes, RA 82 (1988), 76f.; UngnadNRV Glossar, nos. 738-9, 745 etc. 1. 10, 'the lord of the cattle', i.e. Sakkan. I. 11, 'Big Star', i.e. the planet Jupiter. 1.12, 'Dilbat', i.e. the planet Venus. 1.15, 1 (k-a/u-)sheep for the regular offering, fattened with milk (gi-ne-e kab-ri sciGA): in 1.rev. 5, 19 and 22 a k-a/u-sheep is mentioned for the main meal of the morning and the two meals of the evening, each time with the additional remark 'for the regular offering, fattened with milk'. In the summing up of all animals (1.rev. 24-28), however, 4 k-a/u-sheep are mentioned with this additional remark (however without the noun kabri 'fattened', which is probably a slovenlines of the scribe). Therefore the sheep mentioned in I. rev. 15 (for the second meal of the morning), with the same additional remark, is also a ka/u-sheep; the scribe mistakenly wrote UDU.NiTA for UDU ka-lu-u. 1. 16 (see also 28), zt NiG.SILAG.GA: 1.rev. 15 mentions 5 ducks which have been fed dough (NiG.SILAG.GA, l'fsu),while 1.16 mentions 3 geese which have been fed zi NfG.SILAG.GA ('dough (and?) flour', according to CAD, Q, 207b, 9'). However, when the text sums up all the offering animals (I. 24-28), it refers back to the 3 geese, which have been fed dough, now written NiG.SILAG.GA (without zi, 1.27), and it refers back to the 5 ducks, which have been fed zi NiG.SILAG.GA, so now with zi. (I. 28). It is clear that this is a scribal error (the scribe made another mistake in 1.rev. 25, see my comment below), and in all cases we have to translate 'dough'. B. Landsberger (WdO 3 [1966], 252, with n. 25) already pointed out that lfsu is written Zi.SILAG.GA. Cf. also B. Landsberger, O.R. Gurney, AJO 18 (1957-58), p. 330, 1. 173: Zi.SILAG.GA = li-e-[su]. I. 25, UDU ka-lu-u gi-ne-e (kab-ri) sa GA. Kab-ri 'fattened' is mistakenly omitted by the scribe. See my comment on l. rev. 15. I. 31, see CAD, Mil, 89a. Or with W. Farber, TUAT II/2, 231: 'fiir Herz-Opfer im Schlachthof geschlachtet'? Cf. also AHw, 745a, 4, band CAD, NII, 340b, 3, b, but quoted without translation. For the bft mayazzat (or bit maya~~at) see R. Zadok, JAOS 102 (1982), 116a: etymological evidence points into the direction of a 'wall, partitionwall', or 'a kind of gallery which is divided/set apart by a partition/compartment, apartment'. I. 35 (see also 39; 45), (d)TJR.AN.NAki is a Late Babylonian writing for Uruk. See also TU 39, rev. 29; TU 41, rev. 14; BRM 4, 6, obv. 23; 27; rev. 38; 40. Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 40, n. 4. I. 41, probably dNIN.GUBLAGA (EZENxLA) is intended, although the copy reads dNIN.EZENxGU 4. See also KAR 132, I, 10. For 1.40---42 see also CAD, Q, 234b, 4. The god Ningublaga is the son of Nanna and resides in Kiabrig, in the temple EdNIN.EZEN (A.W.Sjoberg, TCS III, p. 25-o, no. 11; cf. G. Selz, Die Bankettszene, Wiesbaden, 1983, 572), but he is also known from Ur (A.R. George, House Most High, nos. 295; 379; see also nos. 103,294,438,499,921). See also K.L. Tallqvist,AGE,402 (NIN.EZEN+B:A.R (GUD)). For the reading NIN.EZENxLA cf. R. Borger, ABZ, p. 242 and 386 with literature. I. 43-50, for the colophon, see A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 8 f.; H. Hunger, AOAT 2, 46, no. 107; P.A. Beaulieu, Studies W.W.Hallo, Bethesda, 1993, 47. I. 45, although in general 16MAS.MAS probably has to be read iisipu, we have evidence that in some literary texts for hiMAS.MAS (with the phonetic complements -su or -si) the learned reading masmassu is used ( cf. CAD, A/II, 435a and Mil, 381 b ). For the Late Babylonian and Hellenistic periods both readings are attested. Based on the syllabic writings of iisipu in the clan list VS 15, 1, I, 8 and the prebend sale YOS 20, 84 (NCBT 1954, unpublished), 2 f. and 6, both from Hellenistic Uruk, G.J.P. McEwan (FADS4, 73) argued that the reading masmassu is to be excluded during the Hellenistic period. This seems to be supported by CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 27 and possibly 29, where we find the a. A description of the daily offerings in the temples of Uruk syllabic writings a-si-pu I a-si-[pu-ti(?)].However, from Late Babylonian Uruk we now also have evidence for the reading masmassu: Sp TU 1, no. 56 (list), rev. 13: lumas-mas-si, and Sp TU 3, 111 (UAR.RA= bubullu),rev. VI, x + 1: Iu(?>mas-mas-su(cf. J. Oelsner, in: Sulmu IV, Papers Presented at the International Conference Poznan, 19-22 September, 1989,235). 1. 46, lu.SAMAN.MAL (usually MAL).LA kul-lu4, see CAD, Sil, 293b, l', contra H. Hunger; AOAT 2, 46, no. 107 (lilSAMAN.MAL.LA NUMUN.LUM '!emender Opferschauer'). I.47, i-nu-us, see CAD, 1-J, 163a, but not certain. 1.48, luSES.GAL-i 'the high priest', Iii.SES.GAL with the phonetic complements -u or -i in texts from Hellenistic Uruk (see also BRM 4, 7, obv. 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, rev. 39, 45), and Babylon (see BM32206 +, I, 20, 22; II, 75; III, 115; Iv, 150; without the pfionetic complements in RA cc., 127ff. passim) probably has to be read abu rabu instead of !e!gallu, cf. CAD, A/1,204-5, ib., S/11,336b, and G. (;agirgan, W.G. Lambert, JCS 43-45 (1991-93), 101a. See also G. Frame, ZA 81 (1991), 42 and A.C.V.M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebabbar Temple at Sippar, 149f., with more references. I.50, is-tur-u-ma 'he has copied' (lit. 'written'), a plural although a singular is intended, see u-bi-il in the same line. b. The New Year ritual TU 39 (AO 6459)6 + TU 40 (AO 6465)7 These two tablets contain the ritual for the seventh month Tasrltu, the New Year festival (akitu) in Uruk. On the basis ofprosopographical evidence we can give it an approximate date. Because TU 39-40 was written by the same scribe as TU 38, it can also'be dated to the first half of the second century B.C. But we canbe more precise here, by way of connecting the data on the scribe of TU 38 and TU 39-40, Samas-etir, with the data on the owner of TU 39-40, Anu-uballit, son of Nidintu-Anu, son of Ina-qibit-Anu, of the familyJjunzu.This Anu-uballit is also known from two extispicy texts, dated 97 and 98 S.E. (215/4-214/213 B.C.),8 and one astronomical text.9 We also know more than one Anu-uballit, son ofNidintu-Anu, of the family Jjunzu from several private contracts.lo So, while the earliest date of scribe Samas-eµr is 118 S.E., the earliest date of owner Anu-uballit is from 20 years before that, 97/98 S.E. Now, although the latest date of Samas-etir is 150 S.E., it is not likely that Anu-uballit was still alive at that time. Tablets TU 39-40 must have been written at least 20 years before 150 S.E., but not much earlier then 118 S.E., because at that time Samas-eµr could not have been working, considering his lotig career. Therefore TU 39-40 must have been written between approximately 115 and 130 S.E. (182/1 B.C.) The text is discussed in II.4.5.1. TU39 U.E. ina INIM dLX u An-tu4 lis-lim Obv. 1 itiDU6.KU UD.1.KAM dEN.LiL dE-a usu-ut UNUGkiii-lab-bis-' 2 gilQIGIR dLX KU.BABBAR gi1QIGIR dLX GUSKIN u4-mu 1-su a-di UD.8.KAMit-ti tar-den-nu sa se-rl 3 a-na Ea-ki-i-tu4 e-lit sa tlLXGIN-ak.MES-ma 111NAR.MESina IGI-su-nu GIN-ak 4 par-~i saba-sa-du ina E :(:JI.LI.KU.GA E.NIRsa E.:(:JI.LI.AN.NA 5 EdNa-na-a up-tar-ra-~ 6 UD.6.KAM dIM dUTU dLUGAL.BAN.DA udNIN.SUN MU4.MU4~' ina EN.NUN.USAN dugA.GUB.BAuk-tan-nu 6 Cf.

Roth, JSS 33 (1988), 1-9. Obv. I. 2, it-ti 'at the time of' (the second meal of the morning), following W Farber, TUAT II/2, 224, seems better than translating literally 'with'. l. 3, GIN-ak a singular although a plural is intended. I. 4, the E.Jjl.LI.KU.GA 'House of Pure Luxuriance' is the name of the bed-chamber (E.NIR) ofNanaja (see M. Stol, in RIA 9 (1998), s.v. Nanaja), situated in the E.Jjl.LI..AN.NA 'House of the Luxuriance of Heaven', the shrine ofNanaja. The .E.ijl.LI.AN.NA is also attested in VS 15, 13, a contract from Hellenistic U ruk concerning the sale of a plot of land, obv. 3 and 6 (gi!KJRl6E.ijl.IL.AN.NA 'the garden of Ebil(i)anna'). Probably it has to be located not in the Esgal, but in the Eanna-temple. Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 26, with. n. 2; 36 and 41; A.R. George, House Most High, nos. 459 and 464. The E.NIR 'bed-chamber' (perhaps representing ¥:eA.NIR = bit tline!Ji 'House of Weariness', see A.R. George, House Most High, no. 899), is also mentioned in the Hellenistic ritual TU 41, obv. 6, here the bed-chamber of Antu in the Res-temple. It is also attested in a Late Babylonian (perhaps Hellenistic) list from Uruk enumerating different sections of temples, SpTU I, no. 136, obv. 8': E.NIR.MMJ [KI] U8.ZE.EB.BA.MU 'Exalted Bed-chamber, place where the sleep is made pleasant'. l. 6, dugA.GUB.BA uk-tan-nu 'the holy water-basin will be set up'; in similar context also in BRM 4, 6, rev. 33. uk-tan-nu is not a plural, but rather a Dt-stem present with 'ii.berhangende Vokal' -u (cf. W.von Soden GAG,¤ 104, g; see also ¤82, e and¤ 18, e): we have two more examples of uk-tan-nu where it is clearly connected with a singular subject. See TU 42 +, rev. 33'(2x). Furthermore we have several examples in Hellenistic rituals of a D-stem present singular tu-kan-nu. See TU 41, obv. 18; 20; 26; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 15. 1.7, l11MU:ijALDIMa-kal.MES or perhaps luMUljALDIM.A.KAL.MES 'bread bakers'? Cf. l11MU.N1NDA,MSL 12, 234. Suggestion M.

CAD, A/II, 265b, 1, a is not certain. Perhaps similar to: 5 ~a-bit '5 gazelle (shaped) vessels'(??), in TU 44, rv,32 (but also not certain)? M.E. Cohen, Cu/tic Calendars, 431 (he only gives a translation) probably reads e'-re-bi and translates: 'the entering' (ofDN 1 and DN2). 1. 10, for dGUSKIN.BAN.DA the text reads dGUSKIN.KU.BAN.DA. I. 16 (see also 20; 22; 25; TU 40, obv. 10(?); TU 39, rev. 18), KISAL.MAij 'Grand Courtyard' of the Res-temple. See also TU 41, obv. 3; 34; TU 42 +, obv. 2; KAR 132, I, 2; 7; 20; 30. The Grand Courtyard of Esagila is mentioned in RAcc., 136, 273 and 146,456. The location of the Grand Courtyard (kisalma!J!Ju),situated by A. Falkenstein (Topographie, 22) in the 'Hof I', is now questioned by A.R. George, suggesting that 'either one of the several other courtyards in the temple's annexes or the principal courtyard of an outer precinct' is more likely (Bi Or 53 [1996], 372). b. The New Year ritual 1.18, GUB-zi-zu (see also TU 40, rev. 8, and TU 40, obv. 18: GUB-zi-zu-'), probably a G-stem perfect plural ittazizzu (var. ittpsizzu) with present meaning (see CAD, MII, 236b, c ), not ( contra AHw, 409b, II, 1, b) izzizu, a G-stem preterite plural, in Late Babylonian also used as present, because a present is attested below I. obv. 26: GUB-za-az. The verb izuzzu in G-and S-stem (cf. W.von Soden, ZA SO(1952), 163-69; id., GAG, ¤ 107a-h; AHw,.408-9, 410a, sub 'Formen') is attested many times, with different spellings. To illustrate the variation in spellings attested in the Hellenistic rituals, we will give here a short survey of izuzzu: 1. 	G-stem (to stand): a. 	present singular masculine: -GUB-za-az: TU 39, obv. 26. -GUB-za: TU 42 +, obv. 32' (GUB-[za(?)]); rev. 23' (GUB-z[a(?)]); rev. 28'; KAR 132, II, 10 (or a plural femine, as in 1.6, 9, 15?); rv,20; 23 (GUB.za-ma). -GUB-az-ma: TU 43, rev. 19 (see also KAR 60, obv. 18). -see also TU 44, II, 14 (GUB). -iz-za-a[z]: TU 43, obv. 8. b. 	present plural masculine: -GUB-zu: TU 42 +, rev.24' (GUB-zu!, copy has GUB-za); KAR 132, II, 2 ([GUB-zu]); 4. 
-GUB-zu.MES: KAR 132, I, 11; 13. 
-GUB-zi.MES: KAR 132, I, 21; rv,I 1. 
c. 	present plural femine: 
-GUB-za: KAR 132, II, 6 (GUB-[za]); [9]; 15. 
d. 	a preterite, iz-zi-za-ma, but in the Late Babylonian period used as present, is attested once: Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 6, obv. 18. e. 	perfect plural, with present meaning: -GUB-zi-zu: TU 39, obv. 18; TU 40, rev. 8; TU 42 +, obv. 19'; KAR 132, II, 16. 
-GUB-zi-zu-': TU 40, obv. 18; KAR 132, II, 13. 
f. Furthermore a precative, li-iz-zu-ka (for lizziz(z)aka, TU 43, rev. 4) is attested. 2. 	S-stem (to make stand), all written syllabically: a. 	present singular masculine: -tus-za-za-ma: TU 44, I, 14; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 14, 5' (tus-za-za). ~ tus-za-zi: Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 10. -tus-za-as-su-ma: Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 17. -see also in Neo-Assyrian texts: tus-za-za-a-ma (KAR 60, obv. 6) and tus= za-az-ma (KAR 50, rev. 8). b. 	We have one example of a preterite: us-ziz (Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 6, rev. 30). 1.19, gi¤tal-lu'carrying pole' see also TU 40, obv. 12. Also attested in the Uruk rituals KAR 132, rv,20, 22, TU 42 +, obv. 18', rev. 8', 19', 32', and playing a major role in BRM 4, 7, obv. 4, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 26, rev. 40. Also known from Babylon: BM 47902 + (W.G. Lambert, RA 91 [1997], 52-56), I, 12-19. In his comments (ib., 56) Lambert suggested that the tallu might have been (or included) a portable incense altar. Note, however, that in TU 42 +, rev. 32'ff. a tallu oflstar is mentioned before offering tables are placed in front of Istar and the other gods and censers are filled, indicating perhaps that the tallu was not used for fumigation but had a different function. Evidence from Neo.Babylonian Sippar supports the translation 'carrying pole' (cf. A.C.V.M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebabbar Temple at Sippar, 21, n. 247), See also RAcc., 141, 370, where based on the context for tallu a crossbeam in the top ofEzida, the cella ofNabu, is probably intended. For tallu '= 'crossbeam(s) supporting a false ceiling below the roof itself', see A.R. George, BIT, 218. I. 20, LAL-a~, a singular although a plural is intended. Other examples where a singular is written (usually LAL-a~). although from the context it is clear that a plural is intended: TU 39, obv. 22 (i-tar-ra-~); TU 40, obv. 19; TU 39, rev. 18; 21 (KU4-ma ... LAL-a~, both singular). I. 20 (see also TU 40, rev. 16; TU 39, rev. 17), dMES.SAG.UNUGki is a later writing of dMES.SANGA.UNUGki. For the latest information on this god see M. Krebemik, in RIA 8 (1993), 94-5. Cf. also TU 41, rev. 3, 5, 9, 10, 18, 20, 33; KAR 132, IY,25. I. 23 (see also 34, TU 40, obv. 20; rev. 4), u-lap-pat 'sprinkle'(?) is probably better than 'smear' (for the latter see TU 41, obv. 10, see my comments on this line; RAcc., 140, 350), following CAD, L, 92a, j. Cf. also TU 42 +, obv. 32'; rev. 26'; KAR 132, III, 18; IY, 11-12. I.27, dPAP.SUKKAL uhiMAS.MAS.MES SU11dLX DAB-bat.MES-ma 'Papsukkal and the exorcists will lead Anu', lit.

The New Year ritual 1.9, KA.MAij 'Grand gate', cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie,10-11. See also TU 41, rev. 9; 12; BRM 4, 7, obv:2. This gate is also mentioned in the building inscription YOS 1, 52, 1.4. 1.9 (see also 14), BARA NAM.[MES], 'Dais of Destinies'. See also TU 41, rev. 6; TU 42 +;obv. 32'; 35'; KAR 132,III, 21. The Dais of Destinies is most likely not located in the Grand Courtyard (courtyard I, cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie,22f.; B. Pongratz.Leisten, ina sulmi frub, 59 f.), but rather in the Ubsukkinaku, the large central courtyard in front of the Anu-Antu-temple, in the Res-complex (Falkenstein's courtyard VI, cf. ib., 10, 13, 22ff.), according to A.R. George, BiOr 53 [1996], 373f. I. 10, KISAL.[MAij(?) rak-su(?)],followingA. Falkenstein,Topographie,23, n. 1. 1. 11, the ES.MAij, located in the Res-temple, is also attested in KAR 132, II, 16; 17. Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie,24; A.R. George, House Most High, no. 281. 1.12,ina mub-bi SAR-ar 'he will write(?) on it', this is rather sudden and strange in this context. Perhaps we should read uqattar 'he will make a fumigation on it' (suggestion M. Stol)? 1.14,n[ap-tan], although the copy before the break reads AN, the context makes it clear that here a meal wasmentioned. However, whether this was the main or the second meal is not clear. TU 40,Rev. 1.4, su/pu-vessel, cf. CAD, S/III,257-8 (see also AHw, 1269b: 'Metalrohrchen'), but contra CAD, K, 83a, c: 'handle', which seems less likely since on other occasions lrallu and sulpu are cleary separated by u 'and' (CT 51, 95, obv. 14); strong evidence can be found in the Late Babylonian ritual LKU, no. 51, rev. 5 where lralluand sulpu are also seperated by u, and furthermore both are preceded by the determinative DUG. 1.6, D[AB-bat.MES-ma], reconstruction following TU 39, obv. 27; TU 40, obv. 14; TU 40, rev. 9; 14. See my comment on TU 39, obv. 27, above. I. 7, BARA NAM.LUGAL.LA 'Dais of Kingship', perhaps also in TU 43, rev. 18. Cf. A. Falkenstein,Topographie,19. 1. 11, KISAL An-tu4 'courtyard of Antu'; for the latest discussion of KISAL see A.R. George, BiOr 53 (1996), 370ff. (contra A. Falkenstein, Topographie,21 with n. 6, and B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi frub, 40, who translate 'Vorzella'). While A. Falkenstein situated the courtyard of Antu in 'Raum 16', the antechamber of the cella of Antu (Topographie,25), A.R. George, ib., 372 suggested that the courtyard in front of this antechamber (Falkenstein's 'Hof! a') is more likely. I. 18 (see also TU 39, rev. 11; 16), for the Ubsukkinaku (UB.SU.UKKIN.NA.KI), also attested in TU 41, rev. 5; 7; 9; 20; KAR 132, I, 4; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 12, obv. 12, see my comments on TU 40, obv. 9. TU39,Rev. 1.2 (see also 3), uzuKJN'liver' (cf. AHw, 1351a, c, CAD, B, 122a, e' and S/1,382a, 3'). It is not attested elsewhere in Late Babylonian ritual texts. 1.2, BARA dLX 'Dais of Anu', cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 19. See also TU 43, rev. 18. 1. 5 (see also 8-9), Ei-sal-lim SILIMirn.MA.AB,an Akkadian recitation incipit, but the translation is difficult: 'the temple will stay intact ( or: will be completed), keep it safe!'(?) (suggestion M. Stol). Cf. CT 16, 7,272: SILIM.MA.AB. Less likely for the second part of the incipit is: SILIM-im_ma ma-lit 'she is filled with peace'. Cf. M.E. Cohen, Cultic Calendars, 432-3, who does not transliterate but translates: 'He is reconciled (to) the house. She is filled with peace'. However, the problem here is that malit refers to a feminine subject while b'ftu (E) is masculine. See 11.3.6. 1.10, the lamentation 'The honored one pf Heaven' is also attested in the Uruk eclipse of the moon ritual BRM 4, 6, rev. 51 and [53] and the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 11 and 13. Also mentioned for the aik b'fti-ceremony in the Uruk cultic calendar text TU 48, rev. 6, see 11.2.2. The lamentation 'Lord, respected one of Heaven and Earth' is also mentioned in the Uruk building ritual text TU 46, rev. 9, an the Uruk m'fspf-ritual text Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 1 (+ //), 24; 25. See M.E. Cohen, Lamentations, 413ff. 1.11 (see also 16), in my interpretation the d'fkbfti-ceremony is the subject of issakkan, but the lamentations in 1.10 can also be subject (cf. W.Farber,TUAT 11/2, 226). 1.15, the lamentation 'The bull in his fold' is also attested in BRM 4, 6, rev. 48, 49, 51, 52, and the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 7, 9, 11, 13. Also mentioned in connection with the d'fk b'fti-ceremonyin TU 48, obv. 13, rev. 5, see 11.2.2. The lamentation 'The honored one who wanders about' is also mentioned in connection with the dfk bfti-ceremony in TU 48, rev. 1, see 11.2.2. 1.19, i-dag-gal-la is a mistake for i-dag-gal-lu. 1.23, us-sa-ba is either a mistake for us-sa-bu (plural) or a rare example of a dualis. I. 23, bi-ru u4-mu, seeAHw, 130b, 3, b. See also 11.2.2. I. 27, ba-lGI (cf. CAD, G, 2b, b, 1) or BA.IOI (c£ H. Hunger,AOAT2, 42, no. 99, 3) for bari is not attested elsewhere.

The New Year ritual 19 	[the la]mentation priest will stand and [will recite] the hand-raising prayer (I. 20) tStrong Anu, revered by [himself{?)], who [alo]ne is Lord (I. 20) [in Heaven and on Earth 1], 20 	to the accompaniment ofa lyr[e]. 21-22-23 [tStrong Anu], revered by himself{?), who alone is Lord in Heaven and on Earth'. Comments obv. 1.1-2, GAM.MA II kip-pat 'loop' (cf. CAD, K, 398, c), or perhaps better 'ring', as one of the royal insignia (cf. AHw, 483a, 4, b)? Cf. also RAcc., 137, 302; 144,415; 145,448. 1. 1-2, BAL.E II pa-la-a, cf. AHw, 817a, 3, a. Or mantle(?), cf. CAD, NII, 32b lex. section. 1.6 and 8, a-na tab-rat 'amazing', seeAHw, 1299b, 3: 'zum Staunen', but cf. also CAD, L, 49a lex. section: 'pleasing to look at'. 1.9-10, following CAD, B, 145a lex. section. See also AHw, 113a, G, 1, c and 2, c. 1.11, ijA.RA.AN.DE.E, we transliterate DE, following CAD, B, 179a lex. section (see also CAD, NII, 292b lex. section): the copy has MURU, which is not ba'u, nor any other verb. For ba'u one would expect DIB (see for example RAcc., 144,413). Because MURU is a sign very similar to DE, CAD probably interpreted MUR.U as a mistake for DE (which is usually sasu and abiilu), being an variant spelling ofDIB elsewhere not attested. 1.13-14, see CAD, S/I, 18a, 1, b; however, the copy does not read KILIB (= LAGAB) but KiLIB (= NIGIN) (see also 1.19). 1.15-16, the translation of the first part follows the Sumerian. The Akkadian line reads: 'your word, when it blew like a wind' (preterite zaqu). Cf. CAD, Z, 64a lex. section. l. 18-19, IGI.ZU {JE.EN.SI.SA.E.NE // li-is-te-sir ma-bar-ka 'may ... proceed into your presence', not li-is-te-'u (contraRAcc., 109; CAD, 1-J,174a lex. section; ib., K, 32b lex. section; ib., SIil, 355b lex. section). The copy clearly reads sir, not 'u. Furthermore, SI.SA is eseru, not se'u. An identical writing is attested in the conjuration CT 17, 26, rev. 82-83 (ijE.EN.SI.SA.'.E II lis-te-sir). See also the incantation KAR 223, obv. 12 (lu-us-te-sir ma-bar-ka 'may I prosper in your presence') and the Neo-Assyrian ritual text IV R2, 23, no. 1 +, III, 15-22 (SI.SA.BI II su-te-sir) (damaged; see below in this Appendix.). A problem is that the Sumerian verb is plural, while the Akkadian verb is singular, but this is a mistake which is also attested elsewhere in this text ( cf. obv. 13-14: MU.UN.SiG.SiG.GA.E.NEI/ i-su-ub and probably also, if restored correctly, in rev.11-12: ijE.EN.SED 7.E[.NE] 1/ l[i-sap-si]-ib). ,á. rev. 1.3-4, for KI~ SU MAR.RA II la-ban ap-pi see also I. 11-12. 199 
1.4, ut-ten-nen-ni 'prayer' is missing in the Sumerian line. Cf. AHw, 1444, utnenu I, 2, a. For the verb utnenu see I. 6. 1.4, li-iz-zu-ka for lizziz(z)iika (cf. RAcc., 109, n.2). See my comment on TU 39, obv. 18. 1.5-6, forli-te-nu-'-u-ka (or li-te-(nen(?) )-nu-'-u-ka ), see RA cc., 109, n. 3; AHw, 1444b, utnenu II, 2, a; W van Soden GAG,¤ 107, v; id., ZA 50 (1952), 181. 1.8 and 10, tes-lit 'invocation/ prayer', or perhaps t~-lit (see RAcc., 109), because the cognate verb sullu 'to pray' and the noun sullu 'prayer' are also attested with the variant ~ullu. 1.12, l[i-sap-si]-it,, probably a S-stem has to be restored, see rev. 8: su-up-su-ut, (but cf. RAcc., 109: l[i-pa-sas-si]-it,). It is singular, although the subject of the verb is clearly 'the great gods', mentioned in I. 9-10. See my comment on obv. 18-19. I. 18-21, also translated by M.E. Cohen, Cu/tic Calendars, 436. 1.18, BARA [NAM.LUGAL.LA(?), following A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 19 (contra RAcc., 109: BARA [NAM.MES).

I. 6, GUB-[za] (cf. also 1. 9; 15), with a feminine plural ending (see also GIN-ak.a-[ma in I. 9), because the subjects of the verb are all goddesses (cf. GUB-zu in I. 4, referring to masculine gods; see also I. 2). Difficult is GUB-za in 1. 10, because the subject or subjects at the end of I. 9 is/are lost. However, since GIN-ak-ma at the beginning of I. IO is singular, and furthermore there does not seem to be much space left at the end of I. 9 for more than one god( dess ), GUB-za here appears to be singular, as in rv,20 and 23.

Kilzappu is also attested in the Late Babylonian cultic text AO 17662, obv. 3 (GIS.GiR.GUB) and the Hellenistic ritual text TU 41, obv. 7 (GiR.GUB.BU). Another possibility is GIS.GiR =kur~u 'foot fetters', links' (CAD, K, 568b) (suggestion M.

The restoration was suggested by A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 48, n. 2. It seems to fit the context, since Anu has reached the other side of the river, and proceeds to the a/cftu-temple.

The text describes the route for the procession of Anu's statue from his cella in the Res-temple to the akitu-temple outside the city. The colophon informs us that the text was written by Anu-baliissu-iqbi, son of the owner of the tablet, Anu-aba-usabsi, son ofKidin-Anu, of the family Ekur-zakir. It is dated 24(?).IV-61 S.E. (251 B.C.).

It is also attested in the building inscription YOS 1, 52, 17. Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 18-20; A.R. George, House Most High, no. 837. 1.3, the unusual spelling i-ko.l-lu-i-ma,also attested in 1.obv. 10; 14; 22; 25, does not occur elsewhere, although the verb ko.luis attested often in Hellenistic ritual texts: TU 45, obv. 14; TU 46, obv. 13; 28; rev. 12; Bagh.

Also the part from 'the Pure Quay, the wharf of the Boat of Anu', up to 'the upper wharf of the Pure Quay' is not mentioned (see KAR 132, rv,1-2; TU 42 +, rev. 19'). Cf. F.

Against this A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 48 argues that the procession had to be long enough to recite a number of incantations; so the gate in question must have been one of the gates in the city wall. I. 21, 'He who surpasses all kings, after he has passed by in the Pure Street', the second part of the incipit probably belongs to the incipit of this incantation, although it looks like a reference to the route which the procession had to take. See F.Thureau-Dangin, RA 20 (1923), 110 and A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 47.

George, House Most High, no. 993. Rev. I'.30, 'The evening (lfllitu, KIN.SIG) meal (miikalil,UNU) of Anu'. Or, with M.E. Cohen (Cu/tic Calendars, 430): '(In) the Banquet Hall (UNU),at the Evening Meal (KIN.SIG) of Anu'? I. 35, ina kun-nu lib-bi-su-nu 'in their steadfast hearts', cf. CAD, K, 543, 2. I. 37, the DU6.KU 'Pure Mound' is the cosmic seat of the king of the gods of Heaven and Earth (Lugaldimmerankia) in the divine assembly, cf. B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi frub, 56; A.R. George, House Most High, no. 178; E.J. Wilson, 'Holiness' and 'Purity' in Mesopotamia (AOAT, Band 237), Kevelaer, 1994, 19-20, who suggestes KU to be translated 'holy' rather than 'pure'. DU6.KU is also another name for the Dais of Destinies (parak sfmiiti), where the destinies were determined during the New Year festival. The DU6,KU is known especially from Nippur, Babylon and Girsu (Lagas), cf. A.R. George, House Most High, nos. 179, 180 and 181. See also II.4.5.2. I.43-49, for the colophon, see H.

Hunger, AOAT 2, 3b, with AHw, 227b, D, 3, b ('richtig b(ehandeln) od mit Kolophon abschlieBen?'), but contra CAD, E, 232b, 5' ('to copy'). uppusu usually follows satliru, so the translation tto copy' is less likely. I. 48, UD.'241, or '25,? }lAcc., 127-154 (DT 15, DT 109) + BM 32485 21 (DT 114, MNB 1848)22 The ritual texts contain parts of the twenty-second and twenty-third tablets of the ritual series concerned with the New Year festival (akitu) of the month Nisannu in Hellenistic Babylon. The ritual instructions for the first of Nisannu are lost; for the second to the fifthday we have several large fragments; the sixth to the eleventh day are also lost. For the date and composition of the text see I.2. The text is discussed in 11.4.5.2. I [DIS]ina itiBARUD.2.KAM 1 DANNAG~ 2 [luJSES.GALZI-ma A.MES iD TU5 3 [ana]IGI dEN KU4-ma tusGADA.LALina IGI dEN 4 [i-d)e-ek-ku ana dEN SUD.BI DUG4.GA 5 UMUN.MU NU.ZA.PA.AG.BI GIS.BU E.NE 6 dENsti ina uz-zi-su ma-bi-ir NU TUK-u 7 UMUN.MU BAAA.SIGs.GA UMUN.MU KUR.KUR.RA 8 dEN LUGAL dam-qadEN KUR.KUR.MES 9 KAR.KARA.DUR.UNA Kl.A.A NU.ZU 10 mu-tir SILIM.MEsti DINGIR.DINGIR GAL.GAL 11 EN.A.NI UMUN.MU A.NA UMUN.MU AN :ijUN.GA 12 dENsti ina ne-kel-mi-su u-sam-qit dan-nu-tu 13 dBARA LU.LU dBARA LU.TDK.A 14 dEN LUGAL.MES ZALAG LU-tu mu-za-'-iz is-qe-e-tu 15 UMUN.MU TVS.MU.SU ms.GAL.LA U.AGA KI.IN.NIR I 6 dENsub-ta-kuEkiBar-sip a-gu-ku 17 [A]N.AN.MU AN.AN.SA.BI PES.E 18 AN-e rap-su-tu gi-mir ka-bat-ti-ku 19 [dJENina JGJll-kuta-bar-ri gim-re-e-tu 20 [inaJUR5.US.ME8-kata-ba-tu URs.US.MES 21 [inaJ ne-kel-me-ku ta-nam-din ur-tu4 22 [in]a Ia-pa-(ti)-ka ta-qam(?)-mu dan-nu-tu 23 [/]a GI-ka ta-kam-mu ina SU11 24 [inaJ nap-lu-si-ka ta-ra-as-sa-su-nu-tu A~S 25 [t]u-kal-Iam-su-nu-tuzALAG i-dab-bu-bu qur-di-ku 26 dEN KUR.KUR zALAG d!.Gi.Gl qa-bu-u SIG5.ME8 27 man-nu sti ka-a-su la i-dab-bu-bu qur-di-ku 28 la i-qab-bi ta-nit-ku la u-sti-pa-a dEN-ut-ku 29 dEN KUR.KUR a-sib E.U4.UL ~a-bitsunna-as-ku 30 ana URU-ku Eki re-se-e~S 31 ana E.SAG.fL E-ku sulJ-bir IGI-ku 32 sti DUMU.MESEki lllERINki-din-nu su-kun su-bar-ru-su-nu 21 This unpublished fragment (see Plate I) covers lines 235---8 (almost entirely lost) and 463---471. 22 For the concordance, see RAcc., 128-9.

I 82. I.474, !GI.TAB u !GI.KAR, both ideograms have the meaning baru 'to collate', so here one of them has to be translated differently, perhaps sanaqu 'to check', cf. H.

In what month this festival was celebrated is not clear. The obverse contains the same ceremonies as those, which for the eighth and ninth day of the New Year festival (alatu) of Anu, during the seventh month Tasritu, have been handed down to us (see TU 39-40). The end of the obverse and the reverse describe the procession of gtar from the E~gal to the akftu-temple, which resembles the Anu-procession described in KAR 132. The text is discussed in II.8.5. Obv. l' [ ... ] ina KISAL [ ... } 2' [.,. a-na}KISAL.MAU rE111 [ ¥¥¥ ] 3' [ ... } dA.DA.PA [ ... ] 4' [ ... ] E.UL.MAS [ ... ) 5' [ ... hlKUR].GAR.RA(?)TA E.SAG [ ... ] 6' dSA.GE.PA.DAd..4s-ka-[... ] 7' [ ... yd'GALGA.MU.NA.SUM.MUdlGI.DU d[, .. } 8' (dURU).INIM-su2 dSES.GALu3 dAlJ-[LA-MAT(?)... } 9' [dBe-l]i-liudBa-ri-ri-i-tu4 TA E.LiL[.LA(?) ... } 10' [ ... ] 4 UR.MAJj LU.U18.LU TA EdLAMA.EDEN dDUMU.SAL.MES E.AN.NAu (dDUMU.SAL.MESUNUGki) 11' [u] dLAMA.SIG5.GA ZI.MES-nim-ma a-na KISAL.SA.BA E11.MES-mai[na(?)... ] 12' dIQI.LA.BAo dJGI.BAR.LU.Tl dKA.BI.LU.SIGsaA.oA d[E.SA.PAR ... ] 13' dNIN.ijE.NUN.NA dEN.UR.AN.NA udSES.AN.TU[R] dNJN.E.AN.NA sa U4-(dan-nu ... ] 14' dSar-rat-AN-eudSA.DAR..NUN.NAdNIN.iMMAd,Sar-rat-BARA dMi-[sar-ri(?) ... } 15' udJ..sar-tu4 TAsub-ti-su-nu Zl.MES-nim-ma ki-ma dUTUKUR-ba DINGIR.MES nap-bar-su-[nu} 16' a-na pa-ni dJNNIN LAL-~ LUGAL tL-ut EN.NADU-us til-le-e-su eb-bu-tu il-lab-b[is1 17' [ ... } ¥ds/J-ra-!Ji-i'-tu4 ZI-am it-t[i ... ] 4 GIN-ak-ma us-ken d¤/J-ra-l#-i-tu18' [ ... sil]tal-luGUSKINE-a-ni a-na ¥dJNNINSUM-in1 [ ¥¥¥ } 19' [ ...

The beginning and end of the text are not preserved. The text is discussed in 11.8.6. Obv.

They will come down to the Grand Courtyard and take up position towards Anu. 4 The exorcist will consecrate the Scepter. Then (the Scepter) will enter and sit on his seat. Papsukkal, Nusku 5 and Usmii will sit in the courtyard of Anu. Then the Shoe, Marat-Anu 6 and Mii.riit-Uruk will return and the Shoe will enter (1.7) the bed-chamber, the 'House with the golden bed' 7 of Antu and will be placed on a footstool. Marat-Anu 8 and Mii.riit-Uruk will sit in the courtyard of Anu on the seats. (The priest) will mix (l. 9) wine and good oil ',! and will make a libation (with it) at the gate of the cella of Anu, Antu and all the (other) gods. 10 He will smear the doorframes of the gate of the cella, the doors and gates (with the wine and good oil). He will fill (l. 11) the golden censers 11 and he will make an offering of ox and sheep to Anu, Antu and all the ( other) gods. 12 The evening meal will be served to Anu, Antu and all the (other) gods. 13 (The meal) will not be cleared. The vigil will continue the entire night. The gate will not be closed. To all the gods, who sit(?) (l. 14) in the courtyard, 14 the meal will be served. In the first watch of the night on the roof of the (topmost) sanctuary of the temple tower 15 of the Res-temple, when the star 'Great Anu of Heaven' rises (and the star) 'Great Antu of Heaven' 16 rises in the constellation Ursa maior, (he will recite) 'Rivaling the glow of the most beautiful of the stars of the sky' (and) 17 'Anu, the king, has risen, the beautiful constellation'. You will set up (1. 18) a golden offering table for Anu and Antu 18 of Heaven. You will lift up a water (basin) for (the washing of) the hands to Anu and Antu. Then 19 you will arrange the offering table. You will arrange beef, mutton and fowl. You will (also) set up (1.20) fine beer 20 together with drawn wine. You will provide all (kinds of) garden fruits in abundance. 21 You will scatter cedar needles(?) and mcz.r!Jatu-flouron a golden censer. Then 22 you will make a libation of drawn wine with a golden libation bowl. On 7 large golden offering tables you will lift up (1.24), 23 for Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and Mars, Moon 24 and Sun, as soon as they appear, a water (basin) for (the washing of) the hands, and you will arrange the offering table. 25 You will arrange beef, mutton and fowl. You will (also) set up (1.26) fine beer together with drawn wine. 26 You will provide all (kinds of) garden fruits in abundance. On 7 golden censers 27 you will scatter m~[Jatu-flour and cedar needles(?). Then you will make a libation (I. 28) of drawn wine with a golden libation bowl. 28 The lumalJlJu-priest,who is girt with a girdle, will light with sulphur fire (1.30) the large Torch, studded (1.29) with aromatics, 29 which has been sprinkled with good oil and on which the washing of the mouth ceremony has been performed. 30 Then he will take up position in the direction of the offering table and 31 he will raise his hands for "Great Anu of Heaven¥ and he will say the blessing (1.32) ~Anu, Lord of Heaven". 32 You will then clear the large offering table and liftup a water (basin) for (the washing of) the hands. 33 The chief temple enterer will lead (1.34) the Torch accompanied by the exorcists, the lamentation priests and the singers 34 from the temple tower and (then) he will enter (through) the Holy Gate, which is behind the cella, to the Grand Courtyard. Then Rev. 1 at the side of the Kizalagga he will take up position towards Anu. In front of him a l,aru.container will be broken(?). 2 He will say a blessing. The (head) temple enterer will (then) lead (1.3) the Torch of Papsukkal, Nusku, Usmii, 3 and Messagunug and they will go to the cella of Antu. Then 4 (the Torch) will take up position towards Antu. In front of her a baru-container will be broken(?). Papsukkal, 5 Nusku, Usmu and Messagunug will go out (I. 6) (from the Antu-cella) with the Torch to the Ubsukkinaku. 6 Next, near the Dais of Destinies an ox will be killed in front of them. A brushwood pile 7 will be kindled from the Torch in the Ub¤ukkinaku. (The priest) will take away (1.8) the shoulder of the ox, together with its hide, 8 and (with it) he will touch the right and left of the brushwood pile. Papsukkal, Nusku, Usmii. 9 and Messagunug will go out (1.IO) with the Torch from the Ubsukkinaku, (through) the Grand Gate, 10 into the street. Then, with Messagunug at the head, Papsukkal, Nusku 11 and Usmii will go with him circling the temple. (Then) they will return and 12 Papsukkal (will enter) by the Grand Gate, Nusku by the Great Gate and Usmii by the Main Gate. 13 A temple enterer will light a brushwood pile from the Torch in front of them and 14 they will sit until dawn. The sangu-priests of the temples ofTiranna (and) secondly the temple enterers of all the temples 15 will light a fire from the Torch and they will carry (it) to their temple. Then 16 they will perform the good-functioning of the temple ceremony. They will kindle a brushwood pile at the gates of their temple. 17 They will say the blessing áAnu will shine forth in all the lands¥ and 'He (Anu, the king) has risen, the beautiful constellation'. 18 The Torch and Messagunug will return and enter the courtyard of Antu. Then d. A nocturnal festival in the Res-temple 19 they will stand before Antu. The exorcist will extinguish the Torch (I. 20) with water from the holy water-basin, fine beer, milk, wine and oil. 20 Messagunug will (again) go and sit (I. 21) in the Ub¤ukkinaku, 21 until daybreak. Adad, Sin, Samas and Belet-ili will sit (1.22) in the courtyard, 22 until daybreak. The people of the land will kindle the brushwood piles in their homes. 23 They will make offerings for the banquet for Anu, Antu and all the (other) gods. 24 They will say the (same) blessing, as before. The city guardians will kindle brushwood piles (I. 25) in the streets 25 and crossroads. The city gates of Uruk until daybreak 26 will not ... The guardians of the city gates will plant (I. 27) standards on the right and left side 27 of the city gates ( and) will kindle brushwood piles in the gates until dawn. 28 On the seventeenth day ( of the month), 40 minutes after sunrise, in front of Anu and Antu the gate will be opened, and the vigil 29 will be ended. The main meal of the morning will be served to Anu, Antu and all the (other) gods. 30 The main (meal) will be cleared and the second (meal) will be served. (The priest) will fill the golden censers and he will make (l. 31) rofferings 1 31 of ox and sheep. The singers will sing. The b[lessing(?)] \ffonored one, wild ox1 [they will say]. 32 (The priest) will fill censers for all the gods and he will mak[ e] offerings of ox and sheep. 33 [(The priest) will le ]ad(l. 34)(?) Adad, Sin, Samas, Messagunug and Belet-ilr to (the room between) the curtains[ ... ]. 34 [ ... ] Comments Obv. I. 2, a lamp in the shape of a shoe is the symbol of Nusku as god of light and fire. See D.O. Edzard, WM I, 116f. For the shoe see A. Livingstone, Mystical, 219, 83 (Marduk's Ordeal). It is also attested in a ritual from Babylon, BM 35019 (A.R. George, BIT, no. 45), obv. l'. I. 3, GIN-ak, a singular where a plural is intended (as in rev. 3 and 11). This kind of mistake has been made several times in this text: -obv. 3, rev. 19, LAL-a~. obv. 5, 8, rev. 14, 22, DUR-ab. 
-obv. 24, in-nam-mar. 
-rev. 15, iL-si-ma. 
= rev. 16, ip-pu-us. 
rev. 16, 22, and 25, 27, i-nap-pa-ab (the subject of this verb in the last two cases, 
luEN.NUNin 24 and 26, must be interpreted here as a plural, see u-zaq-qa-pu, 
rev. 27). á 
for tu-kan-nu in obv. 18, 20 and 26 see my comment on TU 39, obv. 6. 
I. 6, GUR-ru.MES-nim-ma, a masculine plural, although the subjects of this verb (senu, Marat-Anu, Marat-Uruk) are all feminine. I. 10, 'he will smear' rather than 'he will sprinkle', for which in this text salli/Juis used (obv. 29), the translation follows CAD, D, 53-4, 1, a. To smear objects is also attested in RAcc., 140, 350; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, rev. 30; BM 93046 (A.R. George, BTT, no. 44), rev. 3'ff. For laplitu 'to sprinkle' see my comment on TU 39, obv. 23. 1.14, [as-b]a(?),according to RAcc., 119. Perhaps a ventive? Or a mistake for as-bu? 1.16, mulMAR.GiD.DA, eriqqu,see CAD,E, 297b, 3. 1.16, 'Rivaling the glow of the most beautiful of the stars of the sky', the translation of this incipit follows CAD,Z, 121b, 2. 1.17, 'Anu, the king has risen, the beautiful constellation', the translation of this incipit follows CAD, ~. 84b, c. The same incipit, but without dA-mi LU GAL, in rev. 17. 1.21, gi¤ERIN.SiG, luksu 'needles of the cedar(?)', see CAD,240b. Cf. RAcc., 119, n. 2; AHw, 562a, luklgsu, 'Holzspane?'. See also below 1.27 (lu-uk-su). 1. 34, KA.SIKIL.LA 'Holy Gate', cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie,12; A.R. George, BTT,420ff. Rev. 1.1, KI.ZALAG.GA, cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie,24, and A.R. George, House Most High, no. 643. 1.1 (see also 4), duglJa-ru-uina IGI-su ib-bat-ta-qa'a t,aru-container will be broken(?)', cf. AHw, 114b, N, 4 ('durchgeschlagen(?)'); see also A.J. Sachs in J.B.Pritchard, ANET2, 338b. CAD,B, 165a, 10 and ib., 8, 117a, 1, b translate 'will be/is opened', but this is not specific enough because for 'to open' the verb petu was usually used, as for example in CT 15, 44, 17 (see CAD,ij, 117a, 1, b with more examples). For the religious ceremony called l,aru see II.8.3. 1.12, the KA.GAL 'Great Gate', is the station ofNusku. Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 11. It is also mentioned in the building inscription YOS 1, 52, 5. Compare the KA.GAL with the KA.MAU, the station of Papsukkal, see my comment on TU 40, obv. 9. 1.12, the KA.SAG 'Main Gate', is the station ofUsmu. Cf. A. Falkenstein, Topographie, 11=12. 1.23, this is the only place where qeritu is attested in combination with niqu(SiSKUR). Or should we interpret SiSKUR qe-re-e-tihere as a specific sort of offering? (see CAD, Q, 241a, b; B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi irub, 45, n. 32). 1.26, ul ulJ-be-er, one expects a verb 'to close', cf. TU 39, rev. 9: after the vigil the gate wasclosed and at dawn after the dfk biti-ceremony,it was opened again for a new cultic day. 'to close the gate' is not only abullam/babam edelu (in G-, D-and Dt-stem) (see TU 39, rev. 9; 14; TU 41, obv. 13; cf. CAD,E, 25-6; AHw, 185-6), but also turrum (cf. AHw, 1335a, 16, b). Perhaps ub-be-eris a mistake for u-te'-er (suggestion ofM. Stol)? B. Pongratz-Leisten, ina sulmi irub, 45 suggests a D stative of a/Jiiru'IieB er(der m~~ar ilz)nicht aus den Augen?'. d. A nocturnal festival in the Res-temple 1.28 10 US'40 minutes', cf. AHw, 1289a and R. Borger, ABZ, no. 211. I. 31, the taqribtu-lamentation 'Honored one, wild ox' is mentioned here, after which the text perhaps reads: na[q-bit i-qab-bu-u], although one would expect taqribtu (ER). According to F.Thureau-Dangin inRAcc ., 121, n. 2, the traces exclude such a restoration, but the sign before the break may very well be naq-. The lamentation is also mentioned in the Babylon Kislimu ritual BM 32206 +, IV, 162 and in the Uruk cultic calendar text TU 48, obv. 8, see 11.2.2. I. 34, [DAB-batVam-ma 1 (?), '[(The priest) will le]ad(?)'. See my comment on TU 39, obv. 27. e. The kettledrum ritual TU 44 (AO 6479)29 This text contains the most elaborate version of the kettledrum ceremony (lilissu). Although written in Hellenistic Uruk, the text is a copy of an older original, as the colophon specifically states. The owner of the tablet is Anu-aba-ittannu, son of RilJat.Anu, probably, as Wallenfels suggested, of the family Sin-leqe-wmini (known from several private contracts dated ca. 68-73 S.E.), because the Anu-aba-ittannu of TU 44 is a chief singer of dirges (galamlibu) and all attested lamentation priests (kalu) and chief singers of dirges are descendants of the family Sin-leqe-unnini.30 The text is partially a duplicate of KAR 60 and Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5. The text is discussed in II.5. I 1 e-nu-ma LI.LI.iz ZABAR a-na a-[ra-mi IGI-k]a 2 GU4 suk-lu-lu GEt;sa SI.MES ugi~[MBIN].MES sal-mu TA SAG.DU-su 3 EN ap-pi KUN-su 1¥iUM.ME.Am[u-d]u-u it-ta-nap-/a-as-su-ma 4 sum-ma zu-mur-su GIM.

You will burn (I. 18) its heart, 17 (together) with cedar, juniper, ma.rbatu-flour in front of the kettledrum. I 8 You will remove the sinew from its left thigh and 19 you will bury the carcass of that bull in a red ... cloth. 20 You will pour ordinary oil on it.

Beih. 2, no. 7, rev. 7; IV R2, 23, no. 1+, IV,25. I. 8, qaqqara tasabbit me elluti tasallab (KI SAR A KU SU), a well-known phrase, see RAcc., 48, n. 3, BBR 2, 196-7, n. b, CAD, S/1,9b, b, and AHw, 1119b, 3, with more examples. We have several other examples from Uruk: see LKU, no. 48, obv. 2 (late Neo Babylonian or early Achaemenid period); the most important example from Hellenistic Uruk is Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, obv. 9, paralleled by TU 45, obv. 6-7 (partly lost) and TU 46, obv. 7-8 (partly lost). And finally, perhaps the phrase is attested in a small fragment, which contains part of a ritual, Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 14 ( cf. G .J.P.McEwan, BiOr 38 (1981), 640): 1' [ ... ] 'x1 [ ... ]

VAB4, 158, VI, 36; PBS 15, 79, I, 61; AnOr 8, 25, 12)? Similar to the phrase qaqqara tasabbi{ me e/luti tasallab is also Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 8: KI tu_rqad'-da-as A KU SV-ub. See also my comment on TU 45, rev. 8. l. 13, [DUB]-ak 'you will heap up' (tasappak), and probably not tasarraq (DUB-aq) ( cf. RAcc., 10). See BRM 4, 6, obv. 7, where b~~u is also attested with sapilku,in: ba-~ it-tas-pak 'sand is heaped up' (lamentation incipit). See the duplicates Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 16 and KAR 60, obv. [4]. See also my comment on I. 18. l. 15 (see also 24), KAS.U.SA SIG51 is probably 'fine mixed beer' (billatu) (reading suggestion M. Stol), well attested in ritual texts; see for example TU 39, obv. 9; cf. also the dictionaries. Not: KAS usa-pi-e(see RAcc., 10), which is otherwise unknown. I. 16, here and in II, 2 the holy water-basin and Ningirim are mentioned together, a connection which is confirmed by A. Livingstone, Mystical, 176, 1. I. 18, 'you will place' (GAR-an), this verb is also usedin the parallels KAR 50, rev. 4, TU 45, obv. 8 and Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, obv. 11-12. Other parallels have the verb saraqu (DVB-aq): IV R2, 23, no. 1 +, III, 26-27; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 13-14. One has to ask whether in some cases instead of saraquthe verb tabaku(DUB) is intended, see R. Borger, Bi Or 30 (1973 ), 178, 27: ZU.L[U]M(.MA) zlESA ta-tab-bak-ma (cf. CAD, S, 173b). I. 19, based on the syllabic writing duga-da-kur-ru(see also rv,30) it is preferable to read dugA.OA.GURs in Late Babylonian/Hellenistic ritual texts (see TU 45, obv. 9; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, obv. 13; F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no. 12, obv. 9) as adakurru rather than adagurru. 1. 31, [tu-ba-bi-su],the restoration is based on II, 13. See also III, 26 (tu-bab-bi-su). One would of course expect tu-!Ja-abl!Jab-su.Cf. III, 21 (tu-ba-ba); TU 41, obv. 4 (u-ba!Jah-ma);TU 45, rev. 24 and TU 46, rev. 13 (tu-ba-ab). I. 31, bi~-omentum, see D.A. Foxvog, in A.w.Sjoberg,AV, 171b. 1.9 ff., several recitations are referred to here, which are also attested elsewhere. First two incantations in II, 9 and 10: 'Great bull, choice bull, which treads on the pure meadow', also attested in the parallels Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, rev. 19, and KAR 60, obv. 10, and 'O bull, you are a descendant of Anzft', also in Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, rev. 21, and KAR 60, obv. 12. The incantation are recited in full in IV R2, 23, no. 1 +, I, 9 ff. and 19ff. Then follows an ersemma in II, 14: 'Important one, who wanders abound', cf. M.E.

We should not translate (with CAD, S, 19b, 2, b): 'you will pour 4 litres bitqu-flour into (ana) the ordinary flour (sadru) with 4 litres malt flour', because then we have the problem that this mixture is apparently not used for the soaking or for anything else, since the text continues (I. 24-25) to tell us that the hide is steeped (~arlipu)in madder and alum. See the parallels Bagh. Mitt.

CAD, S, 86b, 2'). I. 15-16, F. Thureau-Dangin(RAcc., 53, n. ~1) suggested that the scribe mistakenly omitted several words, and, based on TU 44, II, 17-18 and KAR 60, obv. 9, he restored: [G]U4.M-a-su ta-pal-laq-ma SA-su ina IGI dBALAG[i]nasimLI (gisEREN Zi.MAD.GA ta-qal-laNiG.NA s~LI) ta-sar-raq. e. The kettledrum ritual See also CAD, S, 173a: ina AimLI {ta-qal-laNiG.NA simLI) ta-sar-raq.However, one must ask whether a restoration is necessary, since the short version in KAR 60 can also be found in the Hellenistic parallel text Bagh.

However, in KAR 60 ( obv. 9) and Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5 (rev. 19) this scattering had already taken place, long before the relevant passage with the heart of the bull is described. If we assume correctly that the restoration is not necessary, then we have, with the passage discussed here, an indication for two separate versions. In the Uruk version TU 44 the heart is burned (qa/u)together with juniper, cedar and m~batu-flour, while in the Assur version KAR 60 and the other Uruk parallel Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5 the heart is scattered (sariiqu)with juniper.

The owner of the tablet is Anu-belsunu, son of Nidintu-Anu, of the Sin-leqe-unnini family, and is dated 10(?)-VII-150 S.E. (8-X-162 B.C.) He is also attested in Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 89, dated 147 S.E. (165/4 B.C.) He is the grandson of Anu-belsunu who wrote Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 12, dated 112 S.E., TU 45, with an incomplete date, and TU 46, dated 81 S.E. (see the introductions of these texts, below).34 The text is partially duplicated by TU 44, 1-11and KAR 60. The text is discussed in 11.5. U.E. [ ... ]xx[ ... ] u su-ut(?)

... [...] Obv. 1 When y[ou want to cover the kettledrum (proceed as follows)]. 2 A knowledgeable expert will carefully inspect (l. 3) an ungelded black bull, whose horns and hooves are intact, 3 from its head to the tip of its tail; 4 if its hide (consists only) of black hair, it will be taken for the rites and rituals. 5 If it is spotted with 7 white tufts (which look) like stars, ( or if) it has been struck with a stick (or) touched with a whip, 6 it will not be taken for the rites and rituals. 7 [Whe ]n you want to make the bull enter the workshop, in an auspicious month, on a favourable day, 8 you will step up [to the side of the bull], you will make the ground ritually clean, sprinkle it with pure water. You will set in place 12 bricks. 9 On (the 12 bricks) you will lay down [12 linen] (cloths).

You will make 12 sheep offerings. 14 [Y]ou will bring shoulder, bim~u-omentum and r[oasted meat] near. You will place barley (and) emmer malt. 15 (A piece of cloth of) r[ ed(?)] and blue wool ...

You will [wash its] mouth. You will surround it with [a magic circle offlo]ur. You will set in place a brick (in front of it). 19 You will sc[at]ter a censer (with) juniper.

The kettledrum ritual Comments U.E. u su-ut, perhaps referring to the well known phrase ~Ii.tu u silt pf 'explanatory words and comments'? Cf. AHw, 872b, B, m; ib., 1097a, B; CAD,~. 119, 2; G. Meier, AJO 12 (1937-39), 237 ff.; H. Hunger, AOAT 2, 173a and 177b. Obv. I. 2, GU4', the copy has GA (see also obv. 17; rev. 19; 21; 22; 31), but written correctly in obv. 7. The scribe made more mistakes, see for example obv. 12; rev. 19; 27; 32; R.E. 34. I. 2, sal-rme'1. the copy reads: sal_rIGP. Cf. TU 44, I, 2. I. 7, see TU 44, I, 7; Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 7, rev. 7; IV R2, 23, no. I+, IV, 25. I. 8, [ina A GU4] rzI.GA ~, cf. TU 44, I, 8. W Farber, TUAT II/2, 234 apparently reads: [A.GU].ZI.GA, '(gleich) morgens ... ' 1. 8, tu-rqa~-da-as, 'you will make ritually clean'; the duplicate (TU 44, I, 8) reads tasabbit (SAR), 'you will sweep'. I. 8, LAL-~. a singular, although a plural is intended. See the correct singular in rev. 18 and the parallel KAR 60, obv. 8. I. 11, this line, but without the verb, is also attestedinIVR 2, 23, no. I+, I, 6. Zidubdubbu is often connected with the verb nadu 'to pour' (see CAD, NII, 15; AHw, 707; see also CAD, Z, 107-108; St. M. Maul, Zukunftsbewiiltigung, 56). Because this line has the phrase Zi.DUB.DUB.BU.MES sariiqu, McEwan suggests that Zi.DUB.DUB.BU.MES should be interpreted here, and perhaps also in some other references, as qem serqi 'flour offerings' rather than zidubdubbu 'heaps of flour', since the phrase serqa sariiqu á is well-known (BiOr 38 [1981], 639-40). However, nadu and sariiqu render similar meanings, and the context much more suggests 'heaps of flour' as representatives of the seven children of Enmesarra then 'flour offerings'; this is confirmed by the seven circles on the reverse of TU 41, which stand for the seven children of Enmesarra (see obv. 10-15); these circles probably symbolize heaps of flour. So, in the case of Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, obv. 11 we prefer the reading zidubdubbu for Zi.DUB.DUB.BU. Zidubdubbu is also attested in the eclipse of the moon ritual BRM 4, 6, rev. 45 (see also 46), connected with the verb nadu. See also Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 1 (+ //), 23 (with nadu), and KAR50, rev. 7 (with nadu). For the mythological background of pouring these heaps of flour, see WG. Lambert, JSS 13 (1968), 104-112, especially 109ff. I. 12-13, for tasarraq (DUB-aq), 'you will scatter', the duplicate (TU 44, I, 18) has átasakkan (GAR-an), 	'you will place', which in this context with loaves seems better. See my comment on TU 44, I, 18. Rev. 1.22, ina !GI LI.LI.iZ, see the duplicate KAR 60, obv. 14: ina !GI dLlunba (BALAG). Cf. also TU 47, rev., where dLJLIZ is the representation of the kettledrum (lilissu). 1.23, see my comment on KAR 60, obv. 15-16. I. 24-25, these incomplete lines seem to contain a shorter version of the duplicate KAR 60, obv. 17-18, rev. 1-4: 'The lamentation priest will uncover his head, kneel down and stand at its head.Then he will recite three times: 'He, who lies down' and after this he will say three times thus: "these ritual acts the totality-of-the-gods has performed, I did not perform (them)"'. Cf. W.Farber,TUAT II/2, 235 with n. 24-25a. I. 26, tu-rna-bu,, although the parallel KAR 60, rev. 4 has tu-nab-bi, the sign here appears to be -!Ju. I. 27, ta-leq'-qe-e-ma, the copy reads: di. I. 27, res-tu'-u, the copy reads: res-te-u. I. 28, '[you will co]ver the bro[nze] kettledrum (with it)', see the duplicates TU 44, II, 25 and KAR 60, rev. 8. I. 29, rgi~1NAGAR 'in acorn-shape' (alliinu).

While the Akkadian version has 'the lord' (be-lu4),the Sumerian version reads 'the honored one' (E.LUM). 1.29-30 (see also col. II, 2-3), Mullil is Emesal Sumerian for Enlil. 1.31-32, NA.AM.TAR.TAR.RA II mu-sim si-ma-a-ti, see also Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 6, obv. 5-6. II. 1.2-7, these three bilingual lines are also mentioned in the taqribtu-lamentationEN.EMANI ILU ILU, cf. M.E. Cohen, Lamentations, 189, 34ff. (see also p. 24a and 26a with n. 65) = SBH 44, rev. 29ff. The incipit of this lamentation is also attested in the Hellenistic calendar text TU 48, rev. 4. See 11.2.2. l. 2-3, '[Mullil of the city which he has given (away) so that (-ma) they eat it (i-tak-ka.lu) at once]', this line is problematic: the Akkadian apparently has a Gtn-stem preterite itakkalu,but this is a problem because 'at once' (istenis)does not fit an iterative form. One would expect 'so that it is eaten at once' (innakkalu),because the Sumerian line has the passive form (B[A.AN].GU7.E). Also, note that the copy SBH 44, rev. 30 has it-tak.ka-lu (not i-tak-ka-lu),an N-stem perfect. Cf. CAD, I-J, 280a lex. section (disregards -ma and subjunctive-u), RAcc.,28 and 55, n. 73, and M.E. Cohen, Lamentations, 189, 34 (translation follows the Sumerian). 1. 4-5 and ~7, not only paralleled in SBH 44, rev. 33 ff. but also similar in SBH 58 (IMMAL GUDEDE), obv. 15ff. (cf. M.E.

III, 23; col. IV, 1 and 23), KI.SU.BI.IM: M.E. Cohen, Lamentations, 31a, translates 'It is its kisu', kisu indicating the end of the lamentation. According to CAD, K, 464b kisubu,a Sumerian loan word ofKI.SU.BI(.IM), is: ':finalpart of a hymn'. WhetherKI.SU(.B1)=kz7u, LB killu (seeAHw, 476 'Festhalten;Haft') is connected with this, is not clear to me; the cognate verb kalu can also mean 'to stop', see my comments on TU 45, obv. 14. Related to kisubu is kirugu. kirugu (KI.RU.GU, cf. M.E. Cohen, Lamentations;29a with n. 80) is tuning up an instrument, Kisubuis tuning down an instrument; this happens each time between the ritual acts, after a song; in this way perhaps kisubu came to mean 'stanza' (suggestion Th.J.H. Krispijn, Leiden). 1.20-21 and 22-23, 'the lord, who "draws" his land', GIS.'ijUR.RA II U$~uru,in this context perhaps 'who establishes (the rules of) his land'? Cf. CAD, E, 348b, 2, a, 3', and 2, b. I. 24-27, see SBH, p. 70, no. 39, obv.8f. (similar inSBH, p. 84, no. 47, rev. 8f. and 115, no. 60, rev. 6f.). See also col.

The owner and scribe of the tablet is Anu-belsunu, son of Nidintu-Anu, but the colophon contains an incomplete date; the scribe mistakenly omitted the year number. However, in other ,I documents he is mentioned with his family name: Anu-belsunu, son of Nidintu-Anu, of the family Sin-leqe-unntni, is attested in the building ritual TU 46, dated 81 S.E. (231/0 B.C., see below), the suillakku-prayer Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 12, dated 112 S.E. (200/199 B.C.), the kettledrum ritual Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5, dated 150 S.E. (162/1 B.C., see above) and the list Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 89, dated 147 S.E. (165/4 B.C.).40The Anu-belsunu of Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 5 and no. 89 is the grandson of Anu-belsunu, who wrote Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 12, TU 46 and TU 45. The text describes the rituals which had to be performed for the rebuilding of a temple, after it had fallen into ruin. It is partially duplicated by TU 46, Bagh.

Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, 16--17, and F.H. Weissbach, Misc., no. 12, obv. 13); the interpretation of the incipit was suggested to me by Th.J.H.

Mitt. Beih. 2, no. 10, obv, 5-6 have the second person singular. I. 4, GALA, although van Dijk's copy reads US.SU. 1.5, Esu-a-tu lit. 'that house', the duplicate TU 46, obv. 7 has EDINGIR su-a-tu 'that temple'. I. 7, '9', as in RAcc., 44, rather than '30' (cf. F.H. Weissbach, Misc., 32 and P. Jensen, KB VI/2, 48). I. 11, this reconstruction was suggested by F. Thureau-Dangin (RAcc., 44). 1. 14-38, these lines were also discussed by R. Labat, Les religions du Proche-Orient asiatique, Paris, 1970, 7~77. I. 15-17, 22f., these lines are also duplicated by Bagh. Mitt. Beih. 2, no. I 1, obv. fragment 1, 4' and 7'. I. 17, [SIG4 mab-ri-t]u i-de-ek-ki-ma, see the parallel TU 46, obv. 15. I. 24ff., here the first lines of the prayer Enama Anu ibnu same are presented. See also J.J.A. van Dijk, TIM 9, pl. LXI, no. 77, obverse. It is duplicated by SpTU 4, no. 141, obverse. These lines were also discussed by A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, the story of creation2, Chicago, 1951, 65-66; J. Bottero, Mythes et rites de Baby/one, Paris, 1985, 294-95. The incipit e-nu-ma dA-nu ib-nu-u AN-e is mentioned in TU 46, obv. 19. The incipit is also attested in the astronomical diaries from Babylon, A.J. Sachs-H. Hunger, Diaries, no. -270, B, rev. 15'-17', see my comments in ll.6.2. Another part of Enama Anu ibnu same is probably attested in the unpublished Rm 101 (published here, see Plate IV), as the mention of several deities (Umunmutamgu and Umunmutamnag in line x + 11, Kulla in line x + 15) indicate, but the reading is difficult because the beginning of the lines are lost. The fragment does not belong to the Weissbach tablet, but, based on the script, was probably written in the Late Neo-Assyrian period (see for example the sign LI in line 3 and passim). The text on the reverse is completely lost. 1.27, 'the brick god', i.e. Kulla. Cf. R.S. Ellis, Foundation Deposits, 18ff. 1.28, nab-ni-ti-[la1 '[your] shape' (see also obv. 29: na[b-ni-ti-ki]), i.e. the shape of the first brick, as in obv. 32: nin-da-bi-ki and obv. 36: par-~i-ki (see CAD, K, 348a), rather than: nab-ni-ti-[su-nu], cf. RAcc., 46 and ether editions. For this reason we also restored in obv. 31: ep-se-ti-[la1 and in obv. 34: sa-at-[tuk-la]. Cf. CAD, NII, 29a, b and S/III, 78a. So, the lines 28 ff. are first of all concerned with the first brick, rather than with the temples. 1.30, TI(?), more clear on the copy of van Dijk than ofWeissbach. 1.32, ra-bu-ti(especially clear in van Dijk's copy), as in the duplicate SpTU 4, no. 141, obv. 10? Rev. 1. l'ff., the transliteration presented here is based on TIM 9, pl. LXI, no. 77, teverse, which is better preserved than the rest of the reverse ( cf. J.J.A. van Dijk, Sumer 11 [1955], pl. XII). Nevertheless the translation remains tentative. 1.2', dNIN.SIMUGis also attested in obv. 29. Or should we read dNIN.AI.[GAL ... ), as in obv. 31, here also preceded by Guskinbanda? g. The eclipse of the moon ritual BRM 4, 6 (MLC 1872)46 and BM 13470147 The Uruk text BRM 4, 6 describes the first part of a ritual which had to be performed during an eclipse of the moon. The last section of this text is duplicated by another Uruk text, BM 134701, which also contains the final part of the eclipse ritual.48 For this reason the latter will be presented here again together with BRM 4, 6. Contents and script suggest strongly that both were written during the Hellenistic period. BRM 4, 6 is also partially duplicated by CLBT, pl. 1. BRM 4, 6 and BM 134701 are discussed in II.7. BRM4,6 Obv. 1' [ ... ] uRA[ ... ] 2' [hlGALADUR-ab-ma] ne-pes sti sunI6GALAsti DAR(?)

Brown and the present author in: BM 134701 ¥ 1965-10-14,1 and the Hellenistic period eclipse ritual from Uruk, RA 91 (1997), 147-166). BRM4,6 Obv. 1.2-3, this line is similar to obv. 17. I. 3-13, in these lines several Akkadian translations are given of lines from the Emesal.cult lyric, see Il.7.1. I. 3/it-ta'-#, as at the end of obv. 4? I. 3, E. Ebeling in TuL, 92 restored for the end of this line: [Eturnunna]. I. 4, [sin-nis(?)]-t114,as suggested by E. Ebeling in TuL, 92. I. 5-11, these lines are duplicate in CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 1-14. 1. 5, [lliEN]-ka, see CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 1: be-e[l-ka(?) ... ], rather than puiR]-~, as suggested by E. Ebeling in TuL, 92, who did not use the duplicate CLBT, pl. 1. I. 7, [ina E-i]a ba-~, see see CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 4. l. 7, see for this line also J. Krecher, Kultlyrik, 144. 1.7, i-kal-lu is a mistake for i-kal-la, as in the parallel SBH, p. 133, no. I(!), 66. Several deviations from traditional grammarcan be found in this text: the subjunctive ending -u is missing in iz-bil (obv. 12); iz-za-mi-ir (obv. 14); u-nam-mar (obv. 18, 21, 28, but cf. i-zak-ku-u in obv. 28 and rev. 41); tu-kan-nik 5 (rev. 31) (preterite D-stem, rather than tu-kan-nak). A singular is intended in ik-tu-mu (obv. 8, see the duplicate CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 9: ik-tu-u[m]); a plural is intended in ub-bal (obv. 19), u-sa-a~-bat (rev. 39) and GAR-an (rev. 43, see the preceding plural verb with ventive iL-nim-ma). See also na-pal-si-ilJ (obv. 8, for napalsu!J), SUB-di-u (rev. 38) and i-ru-bu (rev. 48, for ir-ru-bu; cf. KU4-bu in rev. 50, [52] and [53] // BM 134701, obv. [7], [10], 12 and 14). 1.7, CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 6 supplements: sll i-dam-mu-um mar-~i-is Ii-di-mu-mu 'may the moaner moan bitterly'. 1.8, [ina ~ir]-bi, see CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 7'. 1.8, CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 8-9 then reads: Sil dXXX iq-bu-u me-!Ju-u ZI-am-ma i-pi-ir pa-ni ik-tu-u[m] 'Of Sin they said: a storm arose, covere[d] the face with dust'. 1. 10, e-lip-su, see CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 12': gisMA-su. This line is also discussed by R.C. Thompson, AAA 20 (1933), 101-2. I. 11, 'one who does have a heart' i.e. courage. I. 12, CLBT, pl. 1, col. B, 15 ff. different. Similar in J. Krecher, Kultlyrik, 57 and 70, IV, 12 (see also the comments on 187). I. 12, 'The makurru-boat, which (until now) carried cereal offerings', probably an allusion to the boat-shaped moon-sickle. I. 16-21, these lines were also discussed by T. Podella, $om-Fasten, Kevelaer, 1989, 48-49. I. 16, 'light (a fire) with the garakku-brazier', see rev. 38-39. See also TU 41, rev. 15 (nu-ur TA GUZI.LA i-qlld-du-u-ma). I. 17-21, these lines were also discussed by A. Tsukimoto, Untersuchungen zur Toten.pjlege, Kevelaer, 1985, 197-8. 1. 17, 'until he (the moon) has cleared up the eclipse', i.e. 'until the eclipse has come to an end'. See I. 28. 1.22-23, 26-27, rev. 39-40, a generally used apotropaic formula. Cf. CAD, S/II, 152a. I. 24, ummiinu 'soldiers' rather than 'craftsmen', because a sword is mentioned in 1.25. I. 24, imte'(copy: KI)-ru-utiD, followingAHw, 1388b. 1.30, for luSITIM =itinnu 'building master', and not IuDfM =mubannu (cf. KAR 132, III, 3 and 16) the 'arranger (of the offering table)', see III.4.3. 1.30, tifdi-ik-me-en-su, see AHw, dikmenu, 169. Rev. 1.32, the white and black cord are probably already mentioned in the broken beginning of the text; a multicolored cord is also mentioned in BM 134701, obv. 18 and 22. See III.3. 1.33, for Edumununna, the temple of Sm, see A.R. George, House Most High, no. 214. 1.33, for uk-tan-nu see my comment on TU 41, obv. 6. 1.36, for the incantation 'Evil utukku-demons', see II.7. 1.36, for the zipadu-incantation formula see R. Borger, in: AOAT I, 1 ff. g. The eclipse of the moon ritual l. 42:ff. is duplicated by BM 134701, obv. 1 ff. ái l. 42, E am-mu-us-mu, see CAD, A/II, 77a; it is only attested here, and in the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 1. Cf. W. Farber, TUAT 11/2, 239: 'Instrumentenspeicher'. Or is it perhaps related to amaspu (amasmu), see CAD, A/II, 27-8? 1.43, BARA.KI BALAG 'Dais, place (of) the Harp', cf. W.Farber, TUAT11/2, 239. 1.43, TAB s surru 'to begin'. surru is a typical technical verb used in astronomical context. See the syllabic writing in obv. 16, and BM 134701, obv. 17: u-sa-ru-u. I. 45, na-su-u 'raise', i.e. 'recite', as in RAcc., 136, 282 and 283? 1.46, '(filled) with "tears of the holy tamarisk" and water', the verb is attested in the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 5: di-im-ti sa SINIG qu-ud-du-us ume-e ma-l[u-u]. 1.47, a-na kun-nu sun,usually refering to the procedures of the diviner, cf. CAD, K, 543b, 2. Here apparently the lamentation priests were associated with it. 1.48 ff., several Jamentations which are mentioned here are also attested elsewhere: 'The house is encircled Jike a cattle pen', in BRM 4, 6, rev. [53] and the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 14, also in the Uruk cultic calendar text TU 48, obv. 12, see 11.2.2. 'The bull in his fold', in BRM 4, 6, rev. 48, 49, 51, 52, and the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 7, 9, 11, 13, also in the Uruk New Year text TU 39, rev. 15, and TU 48, obv. 13, rev. 5, see 11.2.2. 'The honored one of Heaven', in BRM 4, 6, rev. [51] and [53] and the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 11 and 13, also in TU 39, rev. 10 and TU 48, rev. 6, see 11.2.2. 1.48, or for Ni GIN-rat perhaps bap-rat? See A. Livingstone, Mystical, 90. 1.49, after sun,the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 8 perhaps reads ina. l. 50, MU.UN.[8UL.AM ME.]ER.ME.ER ZI GU1.E, the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 10 reads MU.UN.ijUL.AM ER.SEM.i.MA ME.ER.ME.ERZ! GU1.E, but there appears not to be enough space her~. 1.51, ki-i gam-mar-fl4 GAL-tu4, as is clear from the duplicate BM 134701, obv. 11, but probably a mistake for gam-mar-tu4 TUR-tu4 'the small completion', because we also have ki-igam-mar-tu4 GAL-tu4 in 1.[52] II BM 134701, obv. 13. Cf. CAD, G, 24b. W.Farber, who used BM 134701, reads (TUAT 1112, 239) 'die kleine Vollstandigkeit' in rev. 51 and 'die groBe Vollstandigkeit' in rev. 52, although the writing GAL-h4 is very clear in BM 134701, obv. 11 and 13. 1.54 and 55, the verb i-sit-tam (II BM 134701, obv. 15 and 16) remains unclear to me. Perhaps setu is intended? W.Farber, TUAT 11/2, 239, translates 'raumt ... beiseitelab', but note that he writes in italics, meaning the translation is uncertain. BM 134701 Obv. 1.17, [ki-masaAN,GI6 dJXXX u-sa-ru-u,see BRM 4, 6, obv. 16 and rev. 43. I. 18-19, and 22, see the parallel in CT 16. 21, 180ff. The Akkadian translation reads: u-li-in-na bur-ru-um-ta sa-rat u-ni-qi la pe-ti-ti sa-rat pu-bat-ti la pe-ti-ti {i-me-ma. I. 20, E-a-ni u KA-a-ni 'inside (bftiinu) and outside (biibiinu)'; probably also in rev. 4 (KA.MES).

SUMMARY In this study we have examined-whether the temple ritual texts, which were copied during the Hellenistic period from older original compositions, are a reliable source of information on the cult practices of Hellenistic Uruk. and Babylon. Having surveyed the textual evidence we can conclude that there is enough evidence to suggest that the temple ritual texts indeed describe the cultic activities as they took place during the Hellenistic period. The extensive descriptions of festivals, rituals and offerings in the temple ritual texts show how important the public cults were in Hellenistic times, at least until the first century B.C. Daily, monthly and annual ceremonies are well attested in ritual texts and cultic calendars. Many of the important temple rituals are extensively described, but other less well-known temple rituals are also attested. They clearly show how active the Babylonians were in matters of religion and cult during the Hellenistic period. The large corpus of cult songs (particularly from Babylon) underlines this. Admittedly, these literary texts are copies of older compositions, but the information of other, contemporary sources shows that the cults were still very important in the Hellenistic period. The Babylonian cults practised in the temples of Uruk and Babylon in the Hellenistic period are not different from those attested in pre-Hellenistic times. All the evidence clearly shows that the Babylonians held on to their old Babylonian traditions. We found one possible exception to this rule. From Babylon we may have some references to a local ruler cult for the king and his family, a custom well-known to the Seleucid monarchies. Also, for Uruk. we cannot exclude the possibility that certain texts contain references to a ruler cult practice, in which Seleucid kings were honoured as superhumans. 343
